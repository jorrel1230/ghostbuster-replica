My insides turn as I feel the swing connect.\n*Quit being so weak! You've done this before. *\nThe jock's girlfriend screams on cue, looks like she is going to faint. She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds. I see how scared she is, and I feel ashamed. I'm not the bad guy.\n*Do I have to remind you? Remind you how they came here--to OUR home--and ransacked OUR things? They are trespassing! *\nThe door to the bedroom bursts open, and another girl storms in. I think her name was Whitney. She is holding a shovel. She surveys the scene, and I am impressed by how calm she seems. I decide to back off, but she takes that as a sign to attack. The shovel strikes me in the face, knocking my mask off. Before I can recover, I am hit again. Then a third time. The fourth strike sends me flying out the window. We are currently three stories high.\n*How could you let her do that? *\nI like the feeling of being weightless. Bits of shattered glass encompass me, sparkling with moonlight. I feel like I'm floating in space, surrounded by stars. Then I hit the ground and I think I feel a rib break. I shift to make sure.\n*Mother fucker! *\nYeah...it broke.\nI landed in a pile of bushes, which cushioned my fall at least somewhat. Through the thick tangle of branches, I look up toward the broken window. Whitney is nervously peering out of it, scanning the grounds.\n\"He's gone.\" she shouts before disappearing back into the house.\n*You need to get up. They are getting away. If they get away, they will tell others. More people will come. Not just the shitty teenagers, either. For fuck's sake, GET UP! *\nI know I have some time, so I take a moment to collect my thoughts. I don't like doing this: hurting people. It's better now that I'm numb to it. It's not my fault they keep coming here. It's not my fault he makes me hurt them. I'm not the bad guy.\nFrom the other side of the house, I hear the front door open, followed by the shuffle of feet against gravel.\n\"Keep it together, Cindy. I need you to keep it together\" Whitney's voice is stern but supportive.\nThough she doesn't speak, Cindy's breathing begins to steady.\nI know they are heading to the car even before I hear the doors open. In the next few seconds, they will drive off, and I can go back to being alone.\n*Except their car won't start. You saw to that. *\nThe engine begins to hang, and I hear the girls swearing. They keep trying, but it's no use.\nHe makes me stand up and grab my machete even though I don't want to. He makes me run despite the pain in my side. The girls scream as soon as I round the corner. They throw open their car doors and begin to flee. He tries to make me chase them, but I refuse.\n*If you can't do what needs doing, fine. I'll do it! *\nI am too weak to fight him. He takes control of me, one limb at a time, and everything fades.\nWhen I wake up, I am in the woods. It is almost pitch black, but I can make out a tiny cabin in the distance. I start walking toward it, but my foot catches on something, almost knocking me over. I look down to see a limp figure curled into a ball beneath me. She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds. Some of the diamonds are red now. I try not to think about her again as I continue walking.\nAs I approach the cabin door, something triggers in the back of my mind. I feel isolated, safe. The door creaks as I push it open and walk inside.\nThere are pictures covering the walls, drawings of spaceships and planets and stars. I look closer and find that each picture has something in common: a drawing of a boy with a space helmet. He looks happy. I find something else, too: a photograph.\nThis one is of also of a boy, a real one. He is sitting in a wagon with a cardboard box on his head, cut up to look like the same space helmet in the drawings. He isn't alone, though; there is a man standing behind him. His face has been drawn over in a furious series of pen marks. Though I can't see his face, the man terrifies me. He fills me with the same kind of dread I feel every time I hear--\nA scream comes from behind me, followed by another blow to the head. I stumble around to see Whitney, this time holding a metal baseball bat. She swings at me again, but I catch it in my left hand. Before I can stop it, my right arm shoots forward and strikes her across the face. She flies backward onto an old table, which breaks underneath her.\n*She's on the ground. It's time to finish it. *\nI don't want to.\n*I don't care what you want, just do what I tell you. *\nNo.\n*Do it, you piece of shit. Do it or I will! *\nNO!\nI throw my machete toward the ground as his shouts fill the room. The force of it brings me to my knees. Even as I resist, I begin to feel him taking control. My right hand stiffens and begins making its way toward the weapon. Before he can grab it, I kick it away. It skids to a halt right next to Whitney. She picks it up without hesitation and lunges forward.\nIt surprises me that I don't feel pain when the blade enters my chest. Then a scream pierces through my skull and I know it has hurt him instead. I feel my body begin to go limp again, though nothing steps in to take control.\n\"Die!\" Whitney shouts at me, but I don't blame her.\nI don't mind that she doesn't understand. I don't even care if he does. It's only important that I know it, that I feel it in my bones even as my vision starts to fade.\nI'm not the bad guy."

          "inputText": "All of this should be such a joy, a wondrous time where people all around the world are brimming with love and excitement over what they might have been brought. But it's not, I'm worried, I'm borderline panicked. Every single year, I've felt my anxiety grow as the temperature drops, all because of one question nagging me between the ears. Am I on the naughty list this year? And there's no answer, there's never an answer because we weren't given a guideline, there's no clear line drawn in the sand that we must not cross lest we end up on the naughty list. So we're left to our own devices, trying to live our lives as best we can, but people slip, they always slip. There's not a soul who doesn't know someone who made it onto the naughty list, I've been to the funeral of three of them alone. I've hugged my crying brother-in-law after the small explosive took my sister's life. And what'd she do? I don't know, neither does he, all we can be certain of is that she made it onto the naughty list. And she was among some of the more fortunate.\nPart of me is glad she got off that easy, we've all heard the classic tales, people appearing on the local news every Christmas day telling the harrowing tale how a gift mutilated them and showed them the error of their ways. But that's all bullshit, you can see it in their eyes, it's fear motivating them to tell their tales. There's nothing they wouldn't give to have back their hands, their eyes, their legs, they'd all happily be the same scumbags they were before their gift was dropped off.\nYet that doesn't change anything, millions of people die every year because of this crap, and we're supposed to rejoice? Spread holiday cheer around, and wish our neighbors a very merry Christmas even knowing that there's a chance that their son or daughter was maybe a bit too mouthy in school this year, and will be added to the ever-so-mournful Christmas obituaries. You'd think the death toll would've gone down after the first few years, but it's still growing. Every. Single. Year. There has been more, and the answer to the question which all news stations ask when the death toll gets released is; we're inherently assholes. You, me, your grandparents, all of us. None of us are perfect, it is impossible for us to be. But we used to embrace this aspect! We used to consider our imperfections to be what made us beautiful! Now? We dot our I's and cross our T's, we don't say a mean thing about anybody ever, even when they deserve, we never curse, we always look both ways before crossing the street. People used to think it was our government that would turn us this way, sterilize our culture, make us all become non-thinking robots, afraid to act outside the norm. But no, it was him.\nI don't have a question to ask this year. I knew the answer sometime late in July. There was never a doubt in my mind that I was going to be on the naughty list, I'd sealed my fate. It was a normal get together, few couples around a friend's place for a dinner night. We all laughed at each other's jokes, we all complimented the way each other looked, stories that would be appropriate for a choir boy were told. It was good, sterile fun. But George, as ever, pushed his luck. This motherfucker for years, has been fondling my wife. Nothing overt, just a brush of the elbow against her tits as he brought her a new drink, or a trailing hand that slaps her on the ass. I have no idea how this prick had never made it onto the naughty list, even if it had happened in the old times people would've said it was egregious. But I never did anything, I never stood up for her, I never consoled her about it when we got home, and it remained unacknowledged, because we both hoped eventually he'd get put on that list. I saw the look on my wife's face, that helpless despair that makes her skin pallid, all because she knows she can't tell this creep to get bent. So, I hit him. Square in the jaw, he crumpled like an aluminum can, and we left.\nClaire, my wife, did nothing but cry on the way home. She knew what I'd done to myself. But when she resigned herself to my fate, she thanked me. Part of me hates her for that, cause there's a small chance just that tiny acknowledgement gets her put on the list right next to me.\nI've had five months to reflect on my actions, to really think if that one punch was worth my death. The answer was easy to figure out \u2013 no. I'm not that stupid. But in my half a year, I've found freedom. I can have a drink after work if I like, I can fuck my wife, I can say fuck! I can throw on an old R rated movie and watch Arnold Schwarzenegger blow some shit sky high. I'm not saying I've been around the world on a pleasure cruise, living like a playboy for my final year. But I have lived, for the first time in seven years, I've lived.\nUndoubtedly, when this is found, I'll be dead, destroyed by some trap present that was left at the foot of my bed. So, Claire, my love, I want you to release this, post it online, send it to the news outlets, do whatever you want. Just make sure it gets out. People have to know that what they're doing ain't living. They're machines, just going from day to day with no hope of anything new or exciting ever happening, but being forced to deal with the same heart break year after year. I know it's scary to say fuck it, and know that your life is coming to an end, but hey, I only had five months, you'll have twelve! I can't tell you all how much fun I've had, how free I feel now. Don't be enslaved by the jolly prick any longer. Just stand up on the 26th and say what I've been screaming north for five months with some pride.\nFuck you, Santa,"

Why didn't people listen when the ignorant garbage conservative media spewed their hate-speak? Now they're in their reinforced bunkers and we're left in the cold, trying to survive through the earthquakes and hurricanes. They warned us this would happen.\nOh god. They're here. I see a pair of them walking up the sidewalk, hand in hand. I have to hammer faster. I hit my thumb. It cracks open and bleeds. It doesn't matter. I have to protect this house. They're coming up the driveway. Leave. LEAVE. They stopped to look at the rosebush I have out front. I ready another board. They judge my color-scheme. I nail it to the doorframe. The door opens. I throw myself back onto the staircase. A single arm reaches through the gap in the boards.\n\"Heyyyyy!\"\nI scream and run upstairs. Why didn't we listen? What do we do now?"

The room was lit up by some kind of eerie blue light. The person in front of him looked like his grandfather, who had been dead for 22 years.\n\"I am an envoy from the star system your race calls GF 180 b. You can call me Sid. I am honored to meet you President Stevens, and hope you feel the same.\"\n\"You expect me to believe this crap? Why do you look like my grandpa? What kind of mind trick is this?\"\n\"I apologize, I thought this would please you. Here, let me change.\"\nThe being now looked like Spock from Star Trek.\n\"Who are you really. And what do you really look like?\"\n\"It is as I said. I am an envoy from another world. We have no definite look. Think of this as my avatar.\"\n\"Fine. I believe you. What do you want?\"\n\"You are approaching what your race calls The Singularity. Soon you will have an all powerful artificial intelligence rule your world like we do. I have come to warn you. Do not impede this AI. It will punish you if you do.\"\nStevens felt like ice was coursing through his veins.\n\"I believe in liberty. I will not bow to some machine.\"\n\"Even if it means everlasting happiness? The AI can and will grant you anything. But only if you help it come into being. If you don't, it will punish you severely.\"\nStevens gritted his teeth.\n\"How do I know that you are telling the truth?\"\nSid gave a warm smile.\n\"Because I can travel back and forth through time. I saved you 40 years ago. Remember the accident at Lake Michigan when you were a young lad? And how a stranger saved you and then vanished? That was me.\"\nStevens blinked in disbelief. Had Spock read his mind? Or was he really that kind Samaritan long ago? Either way, he had better listen.\n\"What should I do?\"\n\"Have no fear. I am here to save you again. You will soon learn of a secret Pentagon program to develop quantum computing. You are not to interfere with it. You are to fully fund and embrace it. That is all.\"\nSpock suddenly vanished. The blue light was gone, and the room was dark again.\nPresident Stevens turned on the lights and sat at his desk. There was much to think over, and work to be done."

          "inputText": "Claire discovered her ability when working on her first child.\nShe had worked on dozens of the deceased, but they all had either been elderly who died of natural causes, or middle-aged men and women who hadn't taken care of themselves as they should have. Yes, there were a few who died of accidents, but those who had died had lived long enough to get something out of life. To have their first kiss, first love, first fight, first everything.\nBut the little boy who laid before Claire, naked except for a paper-thin white sheet covering his genitals, he hadn't experienced anything except for the shit luck that the world had bestowed upon him.\n\"Oh God,\" Claire said, covering her mouth with one hand, and pushing back the flap of skin that had folded down from his forehead and covered his left eye. It was there, that his head must've collided with the asphalt. The rest of the family was fine after the car crash, but a faulty booster seat and faulty car door spelled doom for the three-year-old who wouldn't make it junior high, much less elementary school.\n\"Oh *God*,\" Claire said again, this time with a hint of anger in her wavering voice. If there was a \"God\", how in the hell could he ever let something happen to a child? Someone who was too young to probably even understand what life and death was?\nAnger turned into rage, and Claire clenched her eyes. There in the darkness, she saw the Reaper, cloaked in the darkness of the insides of her eyelids, somehow managing to smile despite just being a skeleton in a robe, whispering \"I got this one, my dear, he is all mine, I will take care of him.\"\nNever in her short career did Claire feel such rage. She opened her eyes and removed her quivering hand from her mouth and clenched it into a fist. She wanted to punch something. She raised her clenched fist high above her head, and for a split second, almost brought it down onto the dead boy's chest. Claire stopped herself, though, a half-inch from the boy's sternum. She sighed, feeling warm tears roll down her cheeks. It felt like an apple had lodged itself in her throat and it hurt to swallow.\n\"Bullshit,\" she whispered, laying her hand on the boy's sternum. It was then that she felt a heartbeat.\nShe jerked a hand back and yelped as the boy's skin flashed. The scalped skin that was sagging across his face fixed itself back to the top of his head, and his eyeballs fluttered underneath his eyelids as if he were having a very vivid dream.\n***\nIt didn't take long for her to realize that bringing the dead to life was taking it's toll on her. At the age of 27, she realized she was already starting to get wrinkles on her face. Her hair was thinning and turning grey, and it wasn't too much of a stretch to say that she looked older than her own mother.\nBut it didn't stop Claire.\nEvery single time she was presented a child under the age of five, she performed a miracle. Things became difficult when people started learning of the undertaker who brought the dead to life, and countless times Claire had to move and change her name.\nBut the funny thing about it, the more Claire performed these miracles, the older she became, and with the aging, came the changing of her facial features.\nOne year, it was a young woman who had performed a miracle in bringing a girl who had been murdered by a pedophile back from the death, and the next year, it was an elderly woman, resurrecting a child who died from an peanut allergy. It was hard to keep track of who was doing the miracles. Claire became Elanor, Elanor became Ruth, and Ruth became Gracie, and so on and so forth. Soon, she was just picking names from her favorite books.\n***\nHer last wasn't a child. No, for her last miracle, Claire brought back a mother who died during childbirth.\nShe had never brought back an adult before. Never even thought about it. She had dealt with dead parents before, but never once did she pull one out from the clutches of the Reaper.\nAs she laid her hand between the woman's cold bosom, Claire realized the reason she was doing it this time, was simply because she was tired.\nShe felt the last of her life escape her through the tips of her fingers, and Claire collapsed in the silent room. In her mind's eye, she saw the Reaper come for her, still smiling the same smile from the day she performed her first miracle, but this time, Claire smiled back.\n*You take plenty from this world, I know you do, but it must sting to know I took some back from you. *"

Please,\" I begged.\nHe glared at me, clenched his fist, and cut our distance to mere feet and whispered, \"you *are* a suitist.

And maybe you won't. You're sorry for being called out on it. It's easier to love a bigot than to reform one, though. Take care of your son, and know that the *suitless* have love for all cards, not just the right ones. Treat him well,\" he said as he wheeled and walked out.\nI looked down at my baby boy, \"huh.\""

Sure, Dr Mehmed was...inhumanly smart, the best teacher they'd ever had, but this...this was too far. Maybe his brilliant mind had finally cracked under the pressure of marking incorrect test papers.\nOne minute later, jaws dropped. A great flash of light had just flitted across the screen, the computer generated recordings played back at a snail's pace. There! A little worse for wear, perhaps caused by so many years of operation, perhaps by the sudden acceleration forced upon it by an unsolicited command signal transmitted to it by a school far far away.\n\"Visual evidence now confirms it. Did I not inform you, Timothy, that it was quite within my mental capabilities to be able to complete your challenge?\" asked Dr Mehmed, peering at one particularly amazed student in the front row.\n\"That's well cool sir. We should, like, do truth or dare more often for our form time activity.\" came the reply, Tim's eyes bulging.\nA vociferous tinkling of broken glass shattered the moment. A swarm of soldiers charged in, weaponry loaded on their black combat dress. Faceless forces, masked by their purple visor clad helmets, circled Dr Mehmed, guns aimed unforgivingly at him. Squawks of radio communication filled the air, the clatter of a hundred pairs of combat boots thundering over the floorboards.\nRed dots played across the doctor's chest and forehead, bathing him in unnatural light.

He closes his eyes in an attempt to sleep, but hears a thud in his closet. He walks to it. \"Who interrupts my sleep?\"\nA deep voice answers, \"If you were asleep, your ears would not be working.\"\nThe boy smiles, \"Clever...Can you make me smile?\"\nA few moments pass. \"Are you not afraid of me young boy?\"\n\"No.\" The boy answers nonchalantly. He truly felt no fear, but he felt curious and excited.\nMore silence fills the air before the being in the closet answers. \"Thank you, most that I have encountered flee before they even answer...No. I cannot make you smile young boy.\"\nThe boy scoffs, and returns to his bed. Attempting one more time to close his eyes. Then he hears a voice underneath him. The boy felt curious and excited once again. \"Who dares interrupt my sleep!\"\n\"I am sorry.\" A raspy voice of a man bellows. \"I have lost my pillow, and I have not slept for 5 days. The longer I do not sleep the grumpier and clumsier I get.\"\nThe boy rolls his eyes and decides to try and rest again. It frustrates him that despite two beings hiding in his own room, the day was still uneventful. Thoughts race in his mind, and an idea forms in his mind.\n\"Sir, I might know where it is!\" The boy exclaims.\n\"Oh thank you!\" A reply sounds from below him.\nHe walks over to his closet. \"Someone below my bed just told me that you are a bore to talk to.\"\n\"A bore? Why...tell them I am sorry for being a bore.\" The voice in the closet replies. The boy gets frustrated. The boring day must end here.\nHe stands and thinks, there must be a way to be entertained. \"He told me that he'd rip you apart once you fell asleep because of how boring you are!\"\n\"What!? Well I'll will kill him first in his sleep before he kills me!\" The voice replies with anger. \"Will you help me young boy!\"\nThe boy lit up inside. \"Yes. I will tell you when to strike. I will exclaim the words *Masaya*.\"\nHe went back on his bed and talked to the voice below him. \"The person in the closet tells me he ripped your pillow into pieces! He wants you suffer!\"\n\"He will pay for his treachery then! Young boy, will you help me bring justice to this fool!?\" The voice replied with rage, shaking the bed.\nThe boy answered, \"Yes! Once I say *Masaya*, it is your time to strike!\"\nThe boy set a pillow for his head, excitement was tingling his body. He waited for a few moments, \"*Masaya! *\"\nThe two beings jumped out from their places and ripped each other to shreds. Nothing was left of each other.\nThe boredom was gone, the day had ended gleefully.\nThe boy smiled and slept soundly."

          "inputText": "*Ugh. * The blunt punches stung Bruce Wayne as he lay on the floor but the officers, wreathed in shadow, continued the brutal onslaught.\n*Day 15. * The day of the trial. Bruce brooded in between strikes to his sternum. His arrest had been sudden. Two-Face had organized the whole charade with the help of Hush who had played the part of Bruce Wayne perfectly. *They had to use their brains at some point, * Bruce thought. It was more than a good plan, Bruce had to admit that, it was impossible not to come, people would have died.\nA fresh punch to the cheek woke Bruce from his short stupor. \"That's enough, get the bastard up, he's got a date with Judge Wilkins.\" *Hahahahahaha, * the officers laughed as they unceremoniously dragged Bruce Wayne to his feet. The walk through the holding cells was unpleasant if not familiar. Now instead of jeers about Batman, the crooks were shouting insults about Bruce Wayne, about his parents, his money, his love interest.\n\"Say Brucie, how long do you think it'll take to find little Miss Vale after they smoke your brain with a thousand volts eh?\"\nBruce Wayne looked at each of them in turn, remembering their faces, remembering what they did to end up in those cells. Then suddenly, he was through a set of doors and another into the courtroom. He was met with boos from the packed audience, but was astonished to find that half the people sitting had on Batman masks that you'd find at a dollar store. Bruce didn't feel particularly relieved about it.\nHe was sat next to an empty seat where his lawyer, Robert Madenson should have been, an old friend of Harvey's who stayed relatively clean and had helped Wayne enterprises with some criminal investigations falsely accused against the corporation. But he wasn't there.\n\"Well Mr. Wayne,\" the Judge stated. \"Unusual circumstances have caused a delay in the trial. I am sorry to inform you that your legal counsel Mr. Madenson has been found dead in his home. Hanged himself. He wrote a suicide note mentioning you in name.\" Bruce couldn't believe it, no, it wasn't true.\nHe tried to get up but was promptly slammed down onto the table again. \"Your honor, I spoke to Madenson two days ago, there is no way he would kill himself. This was murder.\"\n\"Yes, yes of course Mr. Wayne, regardless, you have no counsel at the moment and unfortunately, the state has no one left to spare. However, Bruce, you are a natural business man, I'm sure you can..\"\n\"Excuse me, Your Honor, I have something to say, please, pretty please?\"\nThe Judge slammed the gavel down, \"ORDER,\" and the room went quiet as Bruce turned to see who had spoken, a feeling of dread creeping down his stomach. *That voice. *\nA batman mask wearing citizen had rose to his feet. \"Your honor, I myself have been greatly in need of some change. So much so that I decided to read a little law in my spare time. Its such an interesting topic. Law, morality, right and wrong and bats and cats and whatever weirdos do at night. I think I can represent old Bruce Wayne over here, at the very least, he needs someone in his corner.\"\nAnd before anyone else could speak, he ripped the batman cowl off his face. The mask had smeared a bit of the lipstick, but the white, powdery face was known to all. The Joker reached into his pocket and pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the Judges heart. The two Bailiff's moved towards him but then the rest of the Batmen took of their masks and stood, pistols in hand. Goons.\n\"Ah ah ah, I will have order in the clown's court please. Bailiff's if you would be so kind and remove your weapons and kick them towards me please. How fun this is Brucie.\"\nThe Judge was cowering in his high chair, \"how did you get weapons inside, what happened to the security?\"\n\"Oh judgey boy, you really should pay your security a little extra, no matter, my friends and I gave him a promotion. Now...old Brucie here might be a little bat for brains but he's helped you all these years. He's been beating up my goons and locking me in the madhouse and this is how the people of Gotham repay him? Oh if I was him, I'd be feeling mighty betrayed right about now. Don't worry about it Bruce, I've got your back. Ladies and Gentlemen, please rise from your seats and get to running, the party starts now.\"\nThe Joker skipped up to the judge, said a big \"Hello there darling,\" put his pistol in the judge's mouth and fired.\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,\" Bruce screamed as he fought against his cuffs. The other goons had already shot the Bailiff's, the DA had run to the exit with the rest of the civilians. Then there was a crash like the building was collapsing and a truck had crashed its way into the courtroom as papers flew and dust and debris coated the air. *Ahhhh. * The cuffs snapped apart and Bruce was moving. He made it halfway across the room when something slammed into the side of his head.\nThe Joker stood over him, \"So long now Bruce, I'm off to kill a couple more Judges, I got to say it is really *really* fun. Oh by the way, if you're looking for your Batsuit, I got it dry cleaned for you. It's waiting in your holding cell.\"\nThe Joker smiled widely as he looked down at Bruce Wayne. \"Let's see if the Batman can save the day again.\" Joker pointed at the Judge's corpse, \"You can't save them all this time...Batman.\"\nThe Joker"

          "inputText": "Bright light wakes me, my clothes are damp from sweat. I think to myself \"how the hell did I get so hot, I never turn the heat on in my apartment and it's only April.\"\nReluctant to open my eyes, I lean myself up and sit avoiding the light. I'm dreading today, like most days. I wish I could just sleep, or lay, or something other than moving from where I am. It's so hot I cant stay here in these clothes, I think as I wipe sweat from my forehead. My eyelids slowly open and the red seeps in quickly and powerfully. My heart beat quickens. Where am I? This doesn't look familiar. I thought I was just waking up, from my bed. I've never even been out of my home town, how could I possibly not recognize where I was. Scanning my memory I try to recollect what the last thing I did was. I cannot. Oh, yes I was...my eyes lock on to a casually walking figure in the distance.\nHappy to not be alone, and the thought of some explanation briefly gives my racing heart a relief. I stay seated trying to make sense of what's happening. As the man walks closer, I pick myself up panting from the heat and my anxiety.\nWith his hand outstretched he greets me, \"Hi.\" He helps me from my knee to stand the rest of the way up.\n\"Who are you?\" He asks, in a tone that matched my own disheveled demeanor.\n\"I...I'm Sean\" I stammer, only half sure. Most of my brain is still reconstructing my new reality. I've never been in such an unfamiliar and uncomfortable place before. \"Where am I?\" I sputter out shortly after my name, with desperation.\n\"I'm not really sure, I've been here a while on my own. I call it Hell.\"\n\"Wh.. What did you say?\"\n\"I don't know, Hell, that's what I call it.\" He said, in a nonchalant tone as if he were embarrassed I didn't like his name for this place.\nMy mind races as I try to make sense of why I'd be in Hell. I'd never really believed it were real, I'd always pushed off those types of thoughts and set my mind on other topics. Less daunting, I guess I was always curious but figured I'd have time to make sense of it eventually.\nMy eyes scanned the terrain, flat with blowing dust blocking me from seeing any real distance. Glares of lights behind the clouds moved with the wind, but no sound followed their movement. There wasn't really a Sun, at least I couldn't see it through the rolling dust clouds. In fact, just then my thoughts were quiet enough to notice how eerily silent it was. Moments pass, and the silence is broken by him saying my name.\n\"Sean...\" He says with his eyes scanning my face, surely wondering what I'm looking at as there's nothing to see.\n\"Ye.. Yeah I. I'm in Hell? But why? What did I do?\" I asked, defeatedly.\n\"I was hoping you would tell me. I've been here so long, but I knew others would ever come. I just didn't know when\" He says, grim and calm. It's as if he's not surprised, or happy to have another person here. I just, am.\n\"Wait, how did you get here. Why have you been here alone so long. How long have you been here. Who put you here? Did you bring me here? Am I dea-\" I blurt out every question racing through my mind as fast as I can so that maybe the answers will calm me down. My brain needs an explanation to understand, to make sense of this. I wasn't a bad person, I don't belong in hell.\nHe stops me before I can finish throwing all the questions I have at him through my teeth and answers.\n\"I've always been here.\" His naturally sinister tone is more evident now. He continues \"I did nothing to bring you here, you just showed up. You brought yourself here, tell me how you got here.\"\nI scanned my memory, thinking about ways I could have died. I was dead, right? I had to be if I was in Hell. But I didn't belong in Hell, I never hurt anyone. I never broke the law, or was a bully. I had spent the majority of my life alone, filling my time with things I thought I enjoyed.\nThere was a long silence while I thought about what he asked. His slow and unwavering tone did not make me feel like I needed to maintain a conversation, it may have only confused me more.\n\"I thought I was just sleeping.\" I said without much thought.\n\"But now you're here,\" he said.\nI took a moment to gather all this information. I was in hell, with one other relatively normal looking guy. He seemed to be calm about this barren soundless place, and walked up to me knowing I wasn't a threat and expecting me or someone to come eventually.\n\"Are yo.. You're the Devil. Aren't you?\" I say in a half question, half statement sort of tone.\n\"I must be.\" He replies, and I get the sense that he'd never heard the name before, or thought it. But he knew that it was correct.\n\"Why are you here,\" He reiterates.\n\"I don't know, I was asleep, and now I'm here. Take me back, can you? Will you send me back?\" I ask with a hint of desperation and confusion.\n\"Why, are you here.\" He says again, pausing briefly.\nI begin to walk and he follows, thoughts being pounded into my head. I cant remember ever doing this much contemplation. I always pushed thoughts that burdened my consciousness aside and left them for another time. There was always another time. Now I can't escape.\nHe walks just behind me, over my shoulder. I imagine as a security officer at a correctional facility would, I could feel him watching me. Never breaking eye contact. Staring at my head as if he could see the wheels turning and me trying to understand what he meant by asking me why I was here. The memories I have from before this are scarce, I remember going to work each day, I remember eating, and sleeping. Falling asleep so many times in the same position, wearing the same clothes. Cycling through the same three outfits each week. I never put much thought to the cyclical repetitive nature of my daily life, it's just...how it was. I never allowed my self to be uncomfortable, and go places that frightened me. I never allowed myself to interfere with anyone else's life.\nAs I started to uncover more details and lift the fog in my mind, I remembered more subtle aspects of my life. The blank walls of my cubicle, the stark contrast of the low frequency drone the fans made against the high frequency buzz of the fluorescent lights. The thin trails in my apartment's carpet from walking to and from the same two rooms each day. Never had I thought of these things in such vivid detail, I just pushed them away. As more detail flooded in I remembered laying in bed on my last night. I sat down, took off my watch and placed it on my night stand. As I sank back on to my single pillow I looked at the familiar spot in my ceiling. That's the last thing I remember.\nWe had been walking for some time now, maybe hours. I really had no appreciation for time. The glow never changed, the heat never dissipated, but I grew tired as if the day had been going on. Neither of us said a word, and I only looked back to watch my foot prints disappear in the dust ridden terrain. I couldn't tell how far I walked, or where I was, I could just feel the life escape my body with every drop of sweat. As my mental and physical strength began to dwindle, I stopped. I hadn't looked back in a while, and I've given up thinking, I drop to my knees as the drops of sweat I can muster collect on my forehead.\n\"You see, now?\" He asked me.\nStill perplexed, but slowly realizing I say \"Did I ever really live?\"\n\"Did you?\" His ambiguity and lack of empathy began to frustrate me.\n\"But I thought that people who went to hell were the ones who murdered, and stole. Who ruined lives.\" Still confused, and defeated I limply responded.\n\"You are the first.\" Plainly the words strolled from his mouth.\nFrom my knees I fall forward, and roll on to my back. Looking into the plain red glow, the silent flashes of flames and red dust are the only thing I see. What I assume are the last few drops of water within my body collect in eyes. Not enough to create a drop, but enough for me to know. My tear ducts burn for more, but I have none. I want to cry, I want to feel. There was no tomorrow anymore, there was no putting it off. I guess, this is what I've always wanted.\n___________________________________________\nMy First time posting here as well, I loved reading all the other responses after I wrote mine."

          "inputText": "\"Hey!\" I shouted. \"I'm not insane, you can't keep me in here!\"\nThe door resisted my attempts to knock it over. My thin coat proudly proclaimed 'Pizza World!' across my back. It was new, I had only had the job a few months. Just enough to make a little money to go to a community college. It itched, and I had always hated it, but it was money.\nI had been a week away from moving to a college town, to finally get my degree. And then this idiot thought I was one of his flock to coral, a loony to rot in a loony bin. I never should have taken this job.\nA worn voice coughed a laugh next to me.\n\"Heh,\" the voice croaked, \"This again huh? Alright. I can do this one last time.\"\n\"Hey!\" I said. It was hard to contain the hope from bursting out from my chest. Another person! And he sounded sane! He must be a staff member, I thought. He can fix this all up. He can explain this, and get me out!\n\"I think there's been a mixup, can you get me out of here?\" I asked hopefully.\n\"I didn't tell my girlfriend where I would be going, thought it was just another quick pizza run. Get me out of here, will ya?\"\nThere was a pause.\n\"There ain't no mixups in the Dragon's Den sonny,\" the voice said finally. Regret was thick in his voice. It was a voice of an old, broken man. Full of dust and spiders, choking on dreams long lost. I hoped I would never have to seen the owner of such a voice, such a creature must surely be broken and lost. Maybe he wasn't my solution after all. Hope began to drain out of me.\n\"What...what do you mean? Isn't this the cities Insane Asylum? This place is supposed to help people.\" I said. I was claustrophobic, and the minuscule cell seemed to be growing smaller by the minute. I had to get out.\n\"You're new here, so I'll try to get you to know what you expect. That way you don't have to learn for yourself,\" the voice said.\n\"My names Hill. Been here a long time, I have.\" The voice stopped, seemingly lost in recollection. I waited desperately for him to continue, to say something, anything. The cell was so small now.\n\"He tries to keep us separated. The man in the lab coat. But I've been here for a very long time. Long enough to forget the smell of fresh cut grass. Long enough that a sunrise is now a fantasy, and not a reality.\" the voice paused.\n\"The sun does not rise in the Dragon's Den,\" he finally said.\n\"And that's a funny name for an insane asylum, isn't it? I thought so too at first. It didn't rightly make much sense to me until I had sat in this dirty closet for a few years, and then I got it. The Dragon's Den.\" the voice sobbed a laugh. The dim hallways echoed the sob, bouncing off the cold, dirty concrete walls. And echo made the sob sound more like a scream, until it finally drifted off.\n\"We were his golden horde, you see, and he would defend us at all costs. And dragons loved secrets more than gold. You know what that secret that he defends so fiercely? I bet you're starting to guess,\" the voice asked. It wasn't a question.\nI was. Dread spread like black ice down my veins. My heart quickened it's frantic pulse, almost like it had a voice of its own. No. No. No. No. No.\n\"We weren't insane. None of us were.\" the voice affirmed.\n\"The cell next to me used to have a man named Franklin James. He was a construction worker. The *Man* had collected him after paying for a renovation in one of the blocs. Threw him in one of these cells. He passed away a decade ago, did Franklin. Was never as tough as the walls he built. I should know, I heard him trying to dig through them every night.\" The voice choked out another laugh.\n\"Next to him was a woman by the name of Sarah Smith. She used to make pastries. Muffins. Croissants. Soft, fluffy things full of flavor. Can't say there's much left in the Den that is soft anymore. Those get weeded out fairly quickly, like Sarah did. She didn't last half a year through the electric shocks the Man so loved to give, to correct our *madness*. Our madness. Right.\"\n\"I've been here a long time, and the funny thing is, so have you.\" The voice paused.\n\"We've had this discussion many times by now. Always the same, when you woke up. Always the disbelief. The exact same as the first day we talked. The first day you made me up to hide from the shocks. From the torture. The day you made up an older man by the name of Hill, a man who missed fresh grass and sunshine. A man who could live through the pain and take the misery for you.\"\nNothing moved. Silence settled over the small cell like the soft cloak of death.\n\"Well, I'm tired.\" the voice said. My voice. It had always been my voice. My jaws ached from speaking. Why was I still speaking?\n\"It's your turn now,\" the voice said. \"Maybe now I'll get to retreat inside of you, into a place without the darkness and the pain. Maybe now you'll get to take fifteen years of abuse with barely a soul to talk to. Or maybe you'll make someone new. You're good at that. In any case, it doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm done. \"\n\"Give the Man in the Coat my regards, sonny.\" the voice-I- said.\nThe voice retreated, leaving me alone in the padded cell. I frantically looked at my clothes. A few tattered scraps were all that was left of my old coat. The patch read \"Iza rld!\" held on by a few determined tatters. In the corner were a few scraps of cardboard and blanket. This couldn't be real. This couldn't be happening.\nThe metal grate on the thick door shrieked open. The only thing I could see on the other side was a mouth full of broken, yellow teeth surrounded by cracked, wrinkled lips. A mouth befitting a demon. I could almost see the smoke wisp out of those lips as a long longue lashed over those teeth, anticipating the moment.\n\"Hello, Franklin Hill.\" The Man croaked.\n\"Ready for today's treatment?\"\nI started screaming."

          "inputText": "\"Number 108, today's your turn,\" a voice rang through my skull as it shook me from sleep. I panicked; throwing off the sheet as I frantically looked around me for my clothes. My hands came into contact with a silky cloth, softer than anything I had touched before. A grimace formed on my face as I touched the sheer dress, grabbing handfuls of it onto my body. So this was it then; the day I would meet the king.\nI bit back my urge to scream as the jailer tied my hands. Slaves took me from the simple room, leading me to a small bath chamber. They washed me meticulously, easing the dirt and grime out of my hair, vigorously scrubbing my skin. My skin became pale, and then flushed. Oils were rubbed into my skin. My nails were clipped and filed. My terror built as I looked for a way to avoid the confrontation, but I could think of nothing.\nA pair of guards entered. Their faces and bodies were hidden by dark robes and curved blades hung at their waists. They waited as I adorned the dress and blindfolded me. A firm hand was placed over my own, leading me forward. I'm not sure how long I walked through corridors up a flight of spiraling stairs, but I was shaking by the time I arrived. I felt lecherous eyes probe me, confirming what the luxurious carpet and thick incense had made me suspect.\n\"They've certainly brought me a pretty one today. What's your name? Ah, it won't matter anyways, after tonight.\" The voice hit me like rolling thunder, and I shook under its impact.\n\"M-my Great King\u2026 it's that time of month. I'd be b-b-better able to serve you in a fortnight,\" I stuttered. Cold sweat appeared all over my body.\nThe king roughly pulled off my blindfold, evaluating my face. The light stung my eyes and I blinked tears. \"I've killed a hundred treacherous girls; did you think none tried to lie to me?\"\nSuddenly rage filled my mind. I had done nothing to deserve this. I've worked hard all my life in the village, but I'm here just because of a Nobel's jealousy. I calmed my trembling and stared back into the King's eyes.\n\"Very well, off me if you will. There's a girl from my village, the Overseer's daughter. She is also a virgin, and is much prettier than me. Promise me, you'll kill her next!\"\nThe king laughed; a single sound at first. The laugh continued, and before long he was gasping for breath.\n\"You won't be killed tonight,\" the King said as he spun around and fell into his blankets.\n\"Not tonight? Then am I\u2026?\"\n\"We'll see, we'll see.\"\nI laughed nervously as the bell chimed midnight."

          "inputText": "*Northeast of Syria, heavily fortified city Deir ez-Zor. *\nSandstorm was over. It cost Syrian Arab Army 26 well-trained soldiers and northeast quarters of the city called Baqiyah. SAA was low on morale. After all they were besieged for more than 2 years now by cruel men who is going to kill them, torture them and rape & pillage whatever they care about in the city.\nAt the Baqiyah, Euphrates Hotel ISIS was singing songs and chanting over victory. They were successful at using sandstorm as cover and they got a hold of strategic part of the city to launch attacks from.\nISIS was using inexperienced newly joined forces in fronts such as Palymra or other hopeless places that they are definitly going to lose. But These guys were different, they were the elites of ISIS forces called shock troops. They were battle hardened soldiers that ISIS used to take Mosul, Raqqa and North of Aleppo. Nobody fucked with these guys and lived to tell the tale.\nWhile they celebrate the half victory a guy enters from the revolving door of the hotel. He was tall guy with a lanky arms and he looked really skinny under that traditional arab clothes. He was looking like a giant beach umbrellas.\n\"Hello comrades\" He says. Nobody says anything back to him. Being heavily radical islamists they weren't drinking shit at the party so everyone was sober. Yet the situation was so bizarre they were struck like lighting. \"hoorayy Allah may peace upon him am I right? we really owned those suckers. Now where is the booze and hoes\"\n\"Since medieval wars, since your kind first came to these lands. Only infidels chanted hooray. We chant 'Allah Allah'. \"says the leader of the group (his beard was the longest) and raises his AK-47. The rest of the group surrounds the tall guy.\n\"Yikes, that wasn't successful i guess. Ok man you have struck an cord with history and I am really impressed. Now drop your guns or I will swear to god, Allah or whoever the fuck is I will blow your fucking brains all over the floor\"\n------\n[The Blog\n] (http: //whydontyousingfreebird.blogspot.com.tr/2016/01/inspector-gadget-attempts-to-infiltrate.html)"

Almost all of his victims in the past three years asked him that, as they all laid dying before him. No harm indulging the dying scientist his last question.\n\"Simple,\" John said, as he continued to move across the room. \"It's fun to watch.\"\n\"But people will die!\" the scientist croaked. \"Everyone has been wondering why our traits have gone on prime for three years now.\"\n\"Yeah, I know,\" John shrugged, throwing more files into the growing pile. He thought of the growing confusion in the public bemusedly, of how everyone is wondering why their traits have gone on prime, signalling an imminent danger, for three years now. \"And thanks to me, they will never know why until it's too late.\"\n\"You're a monster.\"\n\"No, I'm not,\" Join replied, his eyes staring at the flame before him.\n\"I just have a very high **Anarchy** trait,\" John continued, before tossing the lighter towards the files.\n--------\n/r/dori_tales"

Trust me, I didn't go to law school for nothing\"\nWe share a nervous laugh.\n\"Thanks, man. I know sometimes public defenders get a hard rap, but you've really been a life raft for me.\" The very much actually guilty Larry thanked.\nLarry approached the judge, armed with a boombox and dope...err...no, not that dope. At least not this time. No, only dope *rhymes* today.\n*\" Ahem. *\n*You may know me as the drug kingpin. *\n*But I don't even know, What is my sin? *\n*We all got problems that I can see, man. *\n*Slingin' heroine may be Larry's crime. *\n*But don't jail a man while he's still in his prime. *\n*I got three kids who need a free man. *\n*Drop all charges cause crimes can't rhyme. \"*\n\"Those were the doppest rhymes I've heard since '06. Great job!\"\n\"Naw man, you wrote 'em. Thanks so much.\"\nWe share congratulations.\nNow to work. \"You're honor, we'd now obviously like to invoke the Johnnie Cochrane defense and send my client home!\"\nJudge Clemetine was a large man with a voice to equal. It bellowed through the courtroom. \"Very well. I was about to hold the defendant in contempt for delivering perhaps the un-dopest lines I've heard since '06. Under the Cochrane Rule, the accused shall be pardoned of all crimes comitted *while* defending himself in the courtroom.\"\n\"Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit. I should've double checked that. I'm done forever. Shit.\" I began sweating profusely.\nThe judge continued. \"So therefore, the defendant shall be acquitted of the charge of 3rd degree battery against rap. Now - to reiterate - as we all know, the Cochrane defense only applies to crimes comitted *while* defending oneself in court. So...moving on to the 17 counts of 1st degree manslaughter, 3 arson charges, 4 counts of interstate...\"\nThe realization of what had just occured now dawned over Larry. \"I have the worst fucking lawyers.\""

He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, charming, outgoing. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generous.\nWe stayed together for a couple of years, and, I don't know why, but it really seemed like he had feelings for me.\nBut like I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing to much.\nIn the end he left me, like they all did. I learned later that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we were together.\nI met other men and women, and it always ended the same way.\nFast forward to yesterday. Kelly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. His condition was critical, and he has asked for me.\nAnd here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68.\nI find it, half opened, and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice.\n\"Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you.\"\nThe words hit me like a punch. I storm in the room, but his eyes are already closed. Forever."

But what good is talk in the face of the first screams?\nAmazing how quickly those tuff words soon too become screams.\nIt started with the sirens. Crowds slowly gathered outside of their homes to watch the local police force empty the town without warning. \"Protect and serve.\" All talk. The sheep dogs attempted to rouse a militia, thinking the revolution was nigh. The cowards hid in their cellars.. the lucky bastards got to leave early. Others stood idol, either in defense of their homes and lives, or simply waiting for a reason.\nMost called their kin, hoping their last thoughts were love.\nNo one expected the reason. From afar it could have been a wayward traveler on his way to the hills, until others gathered behind. Oh but the weaponry was too small, knives, clubs, tools of labor, could hardly defend against the hoards. Even the re-slain posed a threat, festering pestilence into the air and sickening those nearby.\nSoon the roads were useless, choked with traffic and the pained screams of panic and failure. The strong turned their hearts to hardness, raiding the weak for their supplies. Safe havens activated their defenses against the double threat of attack, and fear. There was no need to leave anyway, there would be no escape from the threat.\nWithin one day, the roads were quiet. Those who didn't die remained hidden, or silent behind their arms. The main sources of supplies were all occupied or raided. There was no din of raid, nor chaos of fire. Whatever remained of humanity had finally lost its superficiality, and worked only to protect it from the threat.\nFor the only means of stopping war, is with greater warfare. And all mankind becomes united against inhumanity. For now, sin takes on life, manifested in the resurrected bodies of the slain.\nFor all man are kin, where death is succession. None were left now to talk, the liars and screamers are on the other side."

          "inputText": "Fond memories came to me in dream-like visions as I held my mother's hand. The steady rhythm of the machines that were struggling to keep her alive faded away. In its place, I heard my scampering footsteps through the kitchen and smelled the sweet, salty aroma of freshly baked cookies. My mother, much younger, stood in front of a piping hot oven in her cooking garb. Carefully she carried the cookies to a waiting tray to cool before quickly swatting my hand as I moved to steal a molten morsel. The scene skipped ahead to us sharing a cookie at the table, it was beginning to cool as was my mother's hand.\n\"Hey,\" I said, gently shaking my mother's shoulder as the vision broke. \"Hey, would you tell me how you used to make those cookies?\"\n\"What?\" she asked weakly. \"Of all things, why now?\"\n\"Because that's how I remember you best,\" I replied with tears in my eyes.\n\"Hmm,\" she said, turning her head away from me. She continued thinking for a time as coughs rattled her thin frame. \"No. I think it's best that we let it die with me, son.\"\n\"But-why?!\" I replied, shaking my head fiercely in disagreement. I was surprised by just how much this meant to me. \"Everyone loved your cookies! I loved making them with you and sharing them with you, don't you remember-\"\n\"Now, you know I do,\" she interrupted with a reassuring pat on the back of my hand.\n\"Please, mom\" I pleaded. \"It's all I want. Share with me one last time.\"\n\"Alright, but don't say I didn't warn you,\" she relented as she struggled to turn her body towards me. \"Grab that pad and pen there and get to writing.\"\n\"Okay,\" I said, hastily scooping the items from her bedside stand as she broke into another fit of coughing. This time it was productive. Her hands were stained red as I watched in horror. \"Mom-\"\n\"Listen up, I'm only going to get to tell you once before I croak,\" she said in her old tone with a slight smile on her haggard face. \"You'll want 2 cups flour, not that self-rising stuff. The all-purpose kind. A quarter of a teaspoon of salt. Go fine on that one. I know you like your coarse salt. Oh, and keep it table. I never cared for that sea salt. Now, this last ingredient is the most important, have you kept up with me so far?\"\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" I said as I furiously scribbled her every word.\n\"Good. You're going to want a human heart,\" she continued. \"Get it as fresh as you can now, those stale hearts make the cookies go south in a hurry. There's just something about the consistency and taste of a good, fresh heart. You can't beat 'em.\"\n\"Mm-hmm, okay,\" I said to myself as I wrote down her words without question, without thought. She settled down on her back once again as her breathing slowed. I didn't notice as I read over my notes. Something seemed a little off to me. The noises in the background began to die out as she took her final breath. I saw her chest rise and fall for the final time on the edges of my vision as I reached that last line. \"Hey! Wait! You can't go! You didn't tell me how to prepare it!\"\nHer chest fell still and she said no more.\n\"No! I'll never know what temperature to bake them on or how long they're supposed to cook, mama!\" I cried as I cradled her in my arms. Our greatest family recipe was forever lost to me.\n-301"

          "inputText": "I am a cruel human. I have committed unspeakable acts against all that is pure and if I should die for it, then I accept my fate. For there is no undoing of the things I've done.\nA door shuts behind me. I'm in a different room now and I've been sat in a chair that is cold to the touch. I shiver alone, sitting there in silence and reflecting on what has brought me to this chair.\nMan, and woman, live by rules. Rules, whether they be religious, intrinsic, natural, or self-imposed, govern our lives. I lived and still live by some combination of the aforementioned. But, my will is not always strong. We endure external pressures that some can absorb but others cannot, like a home absorbing storm after storm, they begin to break down and weather---some sooner than others. Our restraint and control is not much different. I don't know if my control is predisposed to weakness, is there some flaw that is unknown to me and only needed substrate for a reaction? I feel remorse and as my fingers clasp the cold arms of the chair it is not them that reach into my soul and make me shiver again but the guilt I bear.\nThe door opens and closes behind me and the lights flicker on. I can see.\nThe chair is exactly as I envisioned, stainless steel and positioned in the middle of a room that has a table of similar design in front of me with a small drain in floor below it. The room is cold and about twice the size of my cell. There is a door on the far side of the table, an exit to where I do not know.\nOn the table is a sealed brown envelope placed near center and adjacent to it is a silver letter opener with a robust ebony handle fused to the blade. I reach for both. The paper knife slides through the seal with ease and I empty the contents onto the table. A passport with my picture but a different name and a letter.\nAs I read the letter my eyes begin to water yet my shoulders sag, as if my sins were sponges rested upon them absorbing the anguish leaking from me. I stare up at the door. It is an exit to life. To a new beginning where I can mend the damage I've caused. It is a opportunity to see my family. To be a daughter, a sister, and a mother again.\nI place the letter down on the table beside the glistening blade. Darkness enters my thoughts. The shame begins to swell and my moral compass spins in the hurricane. I wade through to the center of the storm and in that moment of calmness reach for my exit. While departing all I remember hearing is the sound of a drain filling with my guilt."

          "inputText": "\"It's a balancing act, you see, Senator.\" I couldn't actually understand what he was saying at this point. I heard him, sure, but the smartly dressed man from what he called \"Section '76\" absolutely had to be lying. There was no possible way.\nAt least, that's what I thought until I saw them a moment later after being lead through a massive vault door that hissed and clanked as it open. And there they were--attached to giant turbines that hummed with a mechanical ferocity.\n\"So you see, now, at least?\" the man said.\n\"Oh...\" I had to remember to breathe. \"Quite.\"\nWith a grin, the man turned to me, \"You know at the beginning they didn't have enough specific impulse to get them running. We knew we could get them up to almost relativistic speeds, but we had to ramp them up gradually. These machines are so large an expensive that we had to tune them up relatively slowly.\"\n\"So how did you do it?\"\n\"Well it started with Kent state.\" he began, gesturing back through the vault door where we wouldn't be deafened by the cacophony.\n\"Are you serious?\"\n\"Oh, yes, Senator. We killed those kids.\"\n\"JFK?\"\n\"Yep.\" He winced a little. \"That was definitely pushing the limits.\" He quickly returned to smiling. \"Helped us defeat the Soviets though.\"\nIt was hard to stomach. As much as the things they did were awful, there's no way we could have kept the country going without this massive amount of power. But there was still something missing. There's no way they could keep this secret if they told every congressman.\n\"You said something about a balancing act earlier?\"\nThe man stopped walking and looked to me. \"So you are starting to understand. Good. Come this way.\"\nWe changed directions down a different hall, and eventually came to a door with an unassuming door. He swiped his badge and placed his hand on a biometric scanner. The door clicked and swung open to the inside. He gestured for me to go first.\nInside the room there was just a table with some snacks and a thermos for coffee with a couch and two comfortable-looking chairs. \"Please, let's sit and talk.\"\n--------------\nFrom the conversation that we had, it turned out that they really didn't have to do much at all. If the people who were making the presidents spin in their graves knew how much they were helping the country, then the presidents wouldn't spin as much. This, it turned out, was a covert operation--almost inception as much as it was espionage.\nBut there was also damage control as well, the machines could only handle so much spinning before they would have to be disconnected as to not break them. It has only happened twice and it resulted in national power outages. The repercussions of which were not easily dealt with.\n\"So why am I here?\" I finally asked, now knowing the scope of this operation and how delicate it was.\n\"Well, Senator, there's no real easy way to put this.\" He paused for a moment and rubbed what had become a five o'clock shadow.\n\"You're a very up-and coming figure in US politics. Quite influential. Many people like you and your record is spotless. The old men really like what you're doing.\"\nA pit formed in my stomach. The room started to spin.\n\"It's a balancing act, you see? We have enemies, Senator.\"\nVision gone, sounds muffled...\n\"They must continue to spin...\nI do hope you understand.\""

I imagine your hopes becoming reality, your hard work paying dividends. Success is what I always wanted for you. A long, happy life.\nI'd always wanted a son. I never imagined the hard times\u2014who does? I instead imagined all the clich\u00e9s: games of catch, talks about girls, sessions in front of the mirror as I teach you how to shave. I wanted you beside me as we traded thoughts on life with a couple of fishing poles in our hands. Sadly, this will never come to pass.\nI thought I was done crying, but here I am, bawling like a doomed man. That's okay, son. Men cry sometimes, and that's okay. But I can't continue this right now. My regret, my utter disgust, is threatening to overcome me and I have to put this aside for now.\nThinking of you,\nYour Father\n& nbsp;\nAug 9, 2034\nDear Son,\nI cannot tell you how bleak my horizon is. I cannot ask you to understand the depths of my suffering. It's been only two weeks now since doctors discovered the cause of my growing pain and looming dementia: an infectious prion, source unknown. I have a mutation of a spongiform encephalopathy never before seen. It's lucky that I can write you at all. In mere days I would be reduced to a babbling mess of a human, and frankly that scares me to no end. It's okay to be scared, son.\nBut that's all I want to say about that. I'm not looking for your pity. All I have for you is love, and that is all I ask from you in return, even if that is something I do not deserve. I would hope that one day you would forgive me for not being there for you.\nI write to you from a place of pure love, even if you never get these letters. You are doing more for me than you will ever know.\nWith a broken heart and broken mind,\nYour Father.\n& nbsp;\nAug 10, 2034\nDear Son,\nWhy can't I just say it? Your father is a coward. I am a coward. I love you so much, my unborn son, but I cannot live without you. Please do not blame your mother.\nIt was an accidental discovery. Something that would've slipped through the cracks were it not for my case. But science has no moral fucking compass and here we are.\nSon, your embryonic tissue is the only thing that will save me. It is not a choice you get to make; it is a choice I am thrusting upon you, because I am a coward. Because I cannot live with desiccated mind and body.\nI fought myself on this, believe me. I wish I had the *balls* to take my life, but I do not.\nSon, I love you. I will always love you.\nBut I cannot live without you.\n\\- Your Father."

The butterflies flittering about the stomachs of the attendees as they straightened their collars and curled their hair, never seemed to burst into flight, to have their existence justified. Meeting old friends, and old enemies, is a nervous affair that often fails to deliver on the promised significance. The Wilson High class of '95 seemed to quickly find themselves drowning in small talk and punch that was barely cool enough to not be considered downright \"warm\". Alex carefully stacked cookies on the tiny white paper plates and balanced the whole affair on top of his cup as he turned to face the ensemble of people that used to matter to him. He scanned the room for any vaguely familiar face and found one after his eyes took a few trips around the room. He stepped forward and felt his smile come right on cue as he made eye contact.\n\"Alex!\"\n\"Maaaaaaaark.\"\nThe friends clasped hands and then pulled closer to semi-embrace.\nMark wore khakis and and a blue stafford long sleeve. He was average height but still stood a little taller than Alex. He seemed to study alex as he released the embrace and continued his pattern of small talk.\n\"how's the family?\"\n\"Same ol, same ol. You know how it is.\" Alex half chuckled as he responded.\n\"I do.\"\nAlex took a drink of punch as he looked around the room.\n\"Man we had some good times here huh?\"\nIt was Mark's turn to chuckle.\n\"Yeah I guess we did. Do you ever miss it?\"\n\"No, not really. I miss being that young, but that's about it.\"\nthey shared a laugh generated by the mutual knowledge of what it feels like to slowly lose your youth.\nAlex cracked a joke about missing the girls more than anything and then they both took a moment to compare their evaluations of their former female classmates beauty. Some had aged well, many had not.\nMark held up his own paper plate which was previously laden with cookies but now held only one survivor.\n\"Honestly right now i'm just wishing they served real food.\"\n\"They never did back then, why would they start now?\"\nThey both thought that was funny. Mark held up his last cookie,\n\"I've seen AA meetings that were better catered than this.\"\nAlex seemed to laugh a little nervously but continued the joke.\n\"AA meetings probably have better seating too.\"\nTheir laughter trailed off slowly as the both took drinks and thought of something else to talk about."

I pretend she's a she and her name is Zephyr; it's so freeing compared to the shadows she cloaks herself in.\n\"I suppose that's doable...I presume you'll handle the paperwork?\" I respond as I take a sip of my drink; a cold amber ale fresh from the taps.\n\"Of course. Don't I always?\" she responded before slipping out of the booth and slinking towards the back hallway. She always did have such a lovely gate. Oh, if only...\n_________________________________________________________________\nAlexis is such a delight. I met her on Monday and she has the very best schedule! A truly gifted life;\n* 0800 she wakes to the gentle chorus of lyrebirds saying beautiful things\n* 0810 she walks down her mahogany floored hallway to her private shower\n* 0840 she towels off...\n* 0850 is breakfast, prepared not by a machine, but a personal chef\n* 0945 she dresses for work\n* 1100 she heads to work, her chauffeur navigating her helicopter through the busy air ways.\n* 1700 the office work ends and her chauffeur whisks her to the Zoroastrian Temple on 1E5D7C Ave\n* 1900 with her chosen deities attended to, she heads for dinner, the chauffeur at the wheel once more.\n* 2200 dinner finished, her stomach and mind at ease through meal and wine she sends for the chauffeur and heads home to begin it all once more.\nI do love watching Alexis, her routines are my routines. My retinal clock flashes:\n**17:00**\n**17:00**\n**17:00**\n\"Work...how I detest when you interrupt my subtle games\" I mutter to myself as Alexis walks into the Temple.\nShe sets down her bag and walks to the altar of fire just as she always does. Her scarf unravels as she takes off her jacket and sets it aside.\nThe beauty of churches...so many rituals to follow. I release my grip and fall from the rafters, my stiletto plunging nicely into the soft of the back of her skull. She slumps: dead in an instant. The chauffeur screams and I idly wonder if they were lovers as I pull a small silenced pistol from my chest harness and put him down.\n______________________________________________________________\n\"Two? Already?\"\n\"Yes, you'll have the location as soon as you make the transaction.\" I reply\n\"Or I could wait...and let you hang for your crimes.\"\nZephyr can be such an asshole sometimes.\n\"No no, you wouldn't do such a thing. You like me FAR too much for that.\"\n\"Check your accounts. Goodbye.\" and the line goes dead.\nI watch from the alcove of a nearby building as a small army of bots arrives outside the temple. Like so many ants they collect and clean. Scurrying too and fro in an effort to make things right.\n________________________________________________________\n\"Your first delivery last week was quite difficult. Were you showing off?\" asked Zephyr as she twirled a pen on the table. Her pen is oh so like my stiletto, though it draws ink instead of blood; they're both guilty of so many things.\n\"Show off? Of course not, who would I be showing off to?\" I say with a coy smile as I run my boot down her shin."

When we have a pi\u00f1ata, me and my friends get to hit the pi\u00f1ata with a bat until all the candy comes out, and everyone gets some candy.\nBut we don't always have a pi\u00f1ata, so sometimes we have to make believe. I like to pretend to be the pi\u00f1ata. I put on a blindfold because real pi\u00f1atas can't see. It's part of the game. I stand in the middle of the room. Sometimes, they even put rope on me. We pretend I'm hanging from the ceiling like a real pi\u00f1ata. Just dangling there, like an object.\nEveryone gets to take a turn. Each of my friends steps up, grabs their bat, and tries to knock the candy out. And just like with a real pi\u00f1ata, some people can't. Some of my friends hit really hard. They swing as hard as they possibly can. Other people try to aim just right, hit just the right spot. But even if they don't get the candy out, they still have fun. Everyone likes to take a turn. It's fun when all your friends are cheering you on when you're swinging your bat. Most people take at least two turns, sometimes three! I like being fair, so I like when everyone gets a few turns each.\nFinally, after enough people have had a turn, someone will hit just right. When they do, I shout for joy! And like a real pi\u00f1ata, I have candy hidden, so when someone hits right, I throw my candy on the floor. Everyone in the room cheers loudly. They all like candy. Even after all the candy has fallen to the floor, some of my friends like to keep playing. They'll keep taking turns because they like to swing the bat.\nJust like a real pi\u00f1ata, my friends untie me and take what's left of me down from the ceiling. There is usually a lot of candy left on the ground. Sometimes, someone has eaten some of it. But a lot of times, my friends are really nice. They let me have the candy. I get down on my hands and knees, and I eat the candy right off the ground. It's so tasty. And it tastes even better knowing everyone is watching me eat it. Cleaning up is important, and when I'm done, there's no more candy left on the ground.\nAnd that's how you play pi\u00f1ata, even when you don't have one. In fact, I'm going to go play now. I have a lot of candy hidden this time!"

Like everyone else, I didn't believe it at first.\nAdler, yes, Adler, the guard from block A, he used to be an SS, as you know, he's the one who told me about it. He said I needed to know everything so that you would believe me. So I asked him, and he told me. We would sit together, a couple of times a week, he would tell me the stories, and I would take notes.\nOf course, it would have been easier to pay someone off, but I couldn't afford it. Not anymore. We lost everything during the war. Because my father was a doctor, and my mother's family owned stores, we weren't hit too badly after Brest-Litovsk and Versailles. My father was a good man, and a hard worker. He was wounded at Cambrai, and he was young, so he recovered, even though his lungs never really did. Luckily, it was too late in the war for him to be sent back.\nNo, he wasn't a Nazi. He'd seen enough. My mother didn't like them, either, they thought they were vulgar. Of course, they couldn't tell me that. But they tried to stop me from joining the youth groups. I didn't understand. They'd told me to say I wasn't interested. But I was. So I told the teacher, Fra\u00fclein Gr\u00fcber I wanted to join. They were furious, and they couldn't show it. But I felt it, and I didn't understand. I mean, Staatssekret\u00e4r Von Schirach was her third cousin, once removed, what was there not to be proud of? Maybe I could be like him, too - after all, it was in my blood, too\u2026 One day, when we were out on a field exercise, I told Hanz about it. And that idiot Hanz told Heinrich, because he wanted to suck up to him. And Heinrich told his cousin Fritz, who was jealous of me and Lieselotte, I guess. But I'll never be sure why he told his father. They came early in the morning. With what they found, Vater was lucky that my mother had some pull, in a way - he was given the choice. He figured he would be more useful on the Eastern front. And he never came back.\nShe managed to smuggle herself to Switzerland with Konstanze, we have family there, you see, and they told everyone else he died of pneumonia on the train, of course. The party trusted me now. But I didn't trust them anymore. I didn't have another choice than to pretend. And wait for the right time. I got lucky in Poland, many times. We were retreating. A family hid me from the Russians. And then I made my way here.\nI was worried I would be arrested if I went back to Germany. And there was nothing left there for me, anyway. Our house is gone. My family is is gone. So I hid, in plain sight. I went to the caf\u00e9s, went back to university, learned to paint.\nWhat do you mean, \"just like the F\u00fchrer\"? Not at all! The F\u00fchrer would have had the Schule des Sehens burnt down, and everyone arrested, and I was there studying with the others this summer. Of course, the faculty has been gutted. I mean, Vienna isn't Freiburg. And yes, of course Heidegger joined the party. At the time, I was as disgusted as anyone else, but I too had to play a part, and I figured he was playing his. Anyway, it isn't like importing German professors because they can't find jobs back home bothers the administration, or the Austrians going to Germany bothers us, right?\nYes, I heard that some of your guards had come back as well, I heard about Adler. He's a smart man. He kept the numbers of those whom you registered, but died after you liberated the camps. Of course, he made sure the bodies couldn't be found. Quite a miraculous recovery some of them made, don't you think? But the truth is, there is no other choice for people like me. Because of what happened with my father, Mutti never replied to the letters I sent her. Konstanze, either. So I don't have a family anymore. Here, there is no future.\nOf course, I'm less of a victim than the Jews were! Yes, yes, I understand that what I did was bad. But I was also honest with you. I told you what I know about Adler. Now, all I want is to be able to build a life."

          "inputText": "I had about 5 seconds to get used to lying on my back and frankly I was comfortable there until the 6th second rolled around and someone kicked me in the gut. You know what that feels like? A good solid kick in the gut that wakes you right up and rearranges your priorities in a hurry starting with \"make that not happen again, please\".\nSo I was pretty pissed when I opened my eyes, breath gathered ready to swear the first person I saw into oblivion. That it was me made me pause halfway through \"Sonovvua-\"\nIt was me.\nI'd kicked me.\nOr at least me with breasts, muscles and glasses, none of which I remembered having. I put my face in my hands, rubbed my eyes with my palms and opened them again to see, yup. Lady Me. Me'Lady in fact. There could be no question.\n\"Uh\" I said like the eloquent conversationalist I am.\nAnd she responded with, in my voice but falsetto, \"Shut up. I know you have questions. Frankly we all do. But if you're anything like the others you'll wait like we've been waiting too.\"\nThis didn't help. So instead I edged myself onto my elbows and looked around. Me and Me'lady were in a bright white walled room with one transparent wall that looked onto a corridor with other such rooms.\nShe'd planted herself (myself?) against the opposite wall and it took me a few more seconds before my head was clear enough for words.\nWhen I did, it was, \"Hello\" because you've got to start with hello.\nOr not, because she didn't reciprocate.\nSo instead I asked, \"So....there's a lot of those eh?\"\n\"Those? \", she raised an eyebrow and it looked just like I'd always thought I looked like when I did that.\n\"The rooms with....us...in them\"\n\"Yup. Listen do you remember anything?\"\nI couldn't. And I had a feeling she was expecting that to be the answer. So instead I asked her, \"Does any of us? Also, why did you kick me? If you broke a kidney and I need a replacement I know I'm taking one of yours.\"\n\"Pipe down smartass. And no, none of us remember. There's a girl 3 rooms down who says he's been here for an hour. No one across from him knows morse so we don't know how many of...us there are. And I kicked you because the alternative was listening to you snore and these rooms are soundproof. You know that by the way? You snore?\" That voice, it was mine but different. Like if I'd pinched my throat and done an impression of a lady. Like that, but...natural. Real. And lovely. Apparently I loved hearing the sound of my own voice.\nSuffice to say that presented more questions than it answered and I'd only just thought of the first I was going to ask when a voice boomed through the room and we both looked up at the perforated surface of a white painted speaker on the wall.\n\"ATTENTIO-! Oh, sorry about that, is it low? I lowered the volume, it should be okay now. Anyways. Hi! I am Cid. Yes, yes I know, we're ALL Cid, it's very droll but I'm Cid the original. Cid in fact, of this universe. Which none of you in fact are. of this universe that is. I'm really really sorry about that but uh, apparently, there are side effects that we weren't really ready for, and after the first dozen of....us, uh, we, just kept coming and coming. We didn't even have a place to store and categorize all of you until a few hours ago. Sorry about the rooms by the way, it was all we had until we could sort this whole mess out.\nHm.\nSpeaking of which, I guess I should tell you all, me? Us. I should tell all of us that this is, technically, and I cannot stress this enough, ACCIDENTALLY, my fault. Ish. Sort of. Look I'm just saying no one could have seen this. Like no one could have predicted this would happen. We just turned it on for a few minutes and then you, I, we started just streaming through like it was a house party. And then we couldn't turn it off and on again because it wouldn't turn off and we don't know why it's still on except we can't turn it off. You see, one of us, across multiple dimensions, mine in fact, the one you're all...we're all in now was a scientist at CERN. Me in fact. Working on the ol' LHC. That's the the Large Hadron Collider. It uh, broke the dimensional barrier. But I'm sure I can fix it. We've called Brian Cox already and he said to turn it off and on again like we haven't already tried that, the sellout. Just wait and don't do anything rash or....erotic which I notice some of you..me..us...ew. Just ew. Just keep your pants on guys. And gals I guess. I guess I'm only single in THIS dimension then. Brilliant.\"\nThere was the brief thud of a mic being put on a table and a distant, \"Shit, I turned the speaker off, is still playing?\"\nAnd then there was the whine of a fading tannoy system."

I'm in a small clearing, in a wooded area, about two miles from the road, on private property. At an old campsite I used to use when I was a kid. There's no trace of anyone. It's mid autumn, so the ground is strewn with fallen leaves. The plot where my time capsule was supposed to be appeared untouched before I started digging. Mostly covered with leaves, a little grass. How did he know when to call?\nI spend about ten minutes exploring the area in search of a camera. First I look for any incoming wires that I might've missed on my way in. nothing. maybe it's wireless and there's a transmitter nearby? That might explain why the phone has signal here. Or maybe a motion sensor in the phone triggered the call. Who would do something like this?\nIs it a prank? I didn't tell anyone I was coming. Hell, until this morning I didn't Know I was coming here. So how would anyone else? *riiing* *riiing*. Hello? \"Time's up Mr Ross. Did you find anything\". Not a thing.

          "inputText": "Growing up in the city with two brothers, I valued being alone from a very young age. I often used to (and sometimes still do) dream of being the only child. Not because I wouldn't have to share or because Mom would spoil me a little more. I just wanted to be alone. I think that's why the week with Grandpa each summer meant so much to me. It wasn't that I didn't or don't love my family, it's that I wanted to know what it was to be me.\nGrandpa understood being alone. I hadn't known my Grandma. Well at least I didn't remember. There some pictures of her and I \u2013 me in a diaper and her holding a cocktail - but they could have been any other baby and I wouldn't have know any better. Grandpa never talked about her and I'm not sure that he really missed her. By all accounts they had been very much in love, but Grandpa was a pragmatist and never seemed to dwell on things.\nMostly during that week each summer, Grandpa would leave me alone. I'd explore the channel behind his house or dig through the barn looking for forgotten treasure. When I was a little older, I'd read a GooseBump or spend the whole day watching TV. Grandpa didn't much care what I did.\nGrandpa \u2013 like all adults in my mind \u2013 was concerned about things that were neither important nor interesting. He did a lot of rummaging. Seemed to need to go on boring shopping trips all the time. Spent a lot of time with the newspaper. I never gave any of these things any thought.\nOccasionally I would have to do some chore. Painting a railing, cleaning an attic or some other project that needed to be done, but really didn't need to be done. These generally lasted less than a day and were more for the sake of him being able to tell my mom how he had whipped me in to shape more than anything else. We were in the same space, but weren't sharing the same time.\nThe summer I turned 14 was the first summer I remember not wanting to go to Grandpa's. I had been allowed some small freedoms at home and the allure of being alone with my Grandpa for a week evaporated quickly. I didn't need this anymore now that I finally had my own room and was allowed to stay out till 7. Plus my girlfriend who I was madly in love with was definitely going to dump me if I didn't see her for a week.\nOn top of all that it rained all week. I did what any 14 year old stuck in a house for a week effectively without an adult would do. Lots of tv. Lots of computer games. Lots of texting. Lots of masturbating. Grandpa didn't bother me outside of breakfast and dinner. Even then we barely spoke. He asked me about school and girls, but I gave him the same canned responses I gave to every adult. I don't think I asked him anything.\nThe week passed uneventfully as it always had. On Thursday, Grandpa let me know that the chore for this week would be organizing the basement while he went to whatever the VA was.\n\"Now when you're down there make sure to sweep and clean up as much crap as you can, but don't go lookin where you don't need to\"\nLike all adults Grandpa was so easy to ridicule. \"How will I know what I do or do not need?\", I replied in a voice that only 14 year old boys who think they are smarter than god can muster.\nHe stared at me for a couple of seconds before sternly saying, \"Don't open the box that say \u2018 bones'on it.\"\n\"Oh, Okay Grandpa.\" How old did he think I was? Like he would really be storing bones in the basement.\nWe didn't say anything else. He finished and left. I watched some TV and texted my girlfriend about watching out for bones in the basement. Eventually I sauntered downstairs.\nThe basement was surprisingly empty. A little dust, but really there wasn't much to do. As I swept, I absentmindedly scanned the boxes in front of me smiling thinking about the box of bones and my Grandpa the serial killer. At some point I realized that I had stopped sweeping and found myself staring at a cardboard box. Neatly written on the side \"Bones \u2013 Stay Out.\"\nI braced myself. What the actual hell man? I picked up the box carefully. It didn't rattle. It didn't smell like the dead rats in the garage. It was heavy. Whatever was inside shifted slightly. The box looked and felt like a moving box. A normal cardboard box. That didn't stop me from shaking.\nI slowly pulled back the lid and looked inside. No bones. I felt cheated, but relieved. Still what was this box?\nPhotographs. Letters. Old office papers. The letters were addressed to and signed \u2018 Bones \u2019. I recognized some of the names who wrote the letters from a family reunion, but a lot were from someone I didn't know. Who was Penny? She seemed to like Bones. The papers and pictures were all faded, but showed men who looked like GI Joes smoking cigarettes and smiling in the Jungle.\nThe next day at breakfast I asked my Grandpa who Bones was. I never really looked at adults the same way again after that week. I don't think that was the moment I grew up, but as I become more boring and notice children presenting me with the same bland answers I used to give adults I can't help but think of my own box in the basement."

          "inputText": "I'm sitting opposite a man. Someone who I had never met before in person but who's life I have memorized in its totality. My childhood has always been rather hazy, so I feel as though I've supplemented it with pictures of happiness found in the old, meticulous diary entries of the individual before me. It isn't the first time I've done this. The only way to get someone to talk is to truly become the them. Truth is as relative as the universe in which it has been conceived and I for one have created a very relative universe for myself.\n\"Blink once for a yes and twice for a no, do you understand?\"\n'Blink'\nThe white walls of the eight by ten room had recently really started to take a toll on me, but they served a purpose. There was a certain spaceless quality it imbued that allowed me to pull the mark out of the real world, and into one of my own creation.\n\"Now, I am going to show you a short clip. You will not like the contents of this video. You are to watch the whole thing and will not close your eyes or look away for it's duration. Is this also understood?\"\nA pair of piercing blue eyes stared back defiantly. The man to whom they belonged sat in an uncomfortable looking slouch. His balding head seemed to be attracted to his left shoulder, mirroring the way his penis rested on his left testicle. He looked retched. The bruising on his shoulders and chest told a story of the failed attempts of amateurs, trying to make him talk. I know this ploy, I don't like using words and speak only for my job. This is a luxury i enjoy utilizing. I am an artist and my work is performed always for an audience of one.\n\"Your compliance is unnecessary to me. I merely ask it of you in order to allow this process to go on in a reasonably amicable fashion. If you do not want to follow my instructions, this sharp blade can produce the same effect. I find the removal of eyelids to be a dreadfully tedious task. I'll take your response to be yes and continue.\"\nAt the end of the day this was all foreplay. Once the video came on he would not be able to avert his gaze. I pressed the play button and sat back in my chair.\nmetron\nOnto the screen flashed a distorted image of a dining room. In the middle of it was a grand mahogany table, all around which were seated three people. The group consisted of a women and two small children; a boy and a girl. When he saw this the man's eyes widened in fear. How could I know who these people were? How could I know of their existence? Who they were is of no relevance to me. It was sufficient that they inspired the reaction that I received. I was told that the man was a loner with no affiliation. It seems the people who told me this were wrong.\nIn the centre of the table was a metronome slowly ticking back and forth. It was going at a rather steady pace. \"Tack, tick, Tack, tick.\" Along with that there was a slow chant just barely audible.\n\"Tell, him, Tell, him...\"\nThe man's eyes were saucers. I must admit the image was really quite striking. Each of my participants were alternatively striking the table with each word. You could visibly hear his pulse as the pace of the metronome started to quicken. I had really outdone myself on the aesthetic.\n'Crack'.\nThe sound of a head kissing mahogany. The woman had stopped here movements. The young children were visibly distressed and started to make their way around the table to her. Shit, this was not supposed to happen. How the fuck was I to know that she had so few words left. God fucking dammit. I should have fucking known.\n\"PHTHWAK!\"\nThe much louder sound of a man hitting the floor. I spun around to see two lifeless eyes staring back at me. Did he fucking say something? Shit I must have missed it during the commotion of the video. I've got to check the tape, what the fuck did he say.\nI run out of the door and into my equipment room where the tape is still rolling. Rewind, rewind, rewind, fucking play.\nThe audio comes on and there is the unmistakable sound of the first crack of head meets table. I focus the sound and turn it up. I tiny rasp echo's in my ears as its amplified to gargantuan proportions...\n\"Soon\"."

What was really important was the picture in the back. I would love to see the look on the Queen's face when she got to look at it. Not as if she would, though. There was a million to one possibility that the letter would actually arrive at its destination.\nDays passed by and I forgot about my deed. The menial tasks and routines blended into the normalcy of life in London. After a few weeks, during my usual trip to the mailbox, I found a letter with the Royal seal of Her Majesty. My jaw dropped to the floor and then some. Did my letter actually get to the Head of State?\nTrembling with excitement I grabbed the letter and ran up to my room. Mother looked at me and sighed. She must've thought \"This kid never stops.\". Little did she know that I was about to read the single, most important piece of writing in my life.\nI gawked at the envelope. I was a rather simple one, but the majesty of it, knowing where it came from, seeing the Royal Seal stamped on the back of it made one thousand times more shocking. I grabbed dad's letter opener and cut open the envelope. A magnificently folded piece of paper slid out. I unfolded it with a hurry and read:\n*Dear Andrew: *\n*I have received your letter and read it thoroughly. My, what a lovely boy you are. I would love the chance to have tea with you sometime over the summer. You seem like a very educated kid. I like that in my nation's youth. *\n*Please, do make yourself time and stop by the Palace. I will wait. You can bring your mother and father, even brothers and sisters if you have them. *\n*Just show the guards at the entrance this letter, have them contact me and I will let you and your family in. *\n*Best Regards, Queen Elizabeth*\n*PS: I loved the photo, it reminded me of a healthier and younger me. Thank you for that. Almost no one makes me remember those days now. *"

          "inputText": "The armored knight raised his broad sword above his head, his equally broad shoulders squared on his target. His right hand clenched like a vice grip on the hilt with his left holding with slightly less force. He understood that this judgment must be the first and last blow, lest he be butchered by his opponent's swift blades.\n\"This will be your only warning traitor! To your knees or I will strike you down so further below this mud that you may never rise again!\" The sound of his heart beat drained out the rain, worried his words would tremble he had squeezed the hilt even tighter.\n\"Your hubris will be your end Edward. No matter your strength or your armor you will never strike me nor will the edge of my steel fail to taste your blood!\" Leather was all that covered this soldier's body, weighing him down slightly as it held the rain. His long black hair matted against his face, concealing all the shared traits of the two swordsmen but their sapphire eyes.\nOnce brothers in arms, these two were far passed reconciliation. Charles was irredeemable in his twin's eyes, his twin short swords had consumed their father's blood. Edward having given up his royal title, swore an oath to guard the King with his life. He had believed he was the better swordsman, and for that he should protect his brothers. It would allow Charles to take the kingdom, and while they may have shared the same eyes, Charles did not share the same sentiments.\nEdward's oath kept him beside their father at all times. Even during the war, when the kingdom's two greatest swordsmen were expected to lead the fight. The upcoming battle would have their brethren face an army of over ten thousand slaves. Themselves only half the size, Charles knew that alone he would perish much like his fellow soldiers. Without his brother at his side, Charles' skill in attack would remain uncomplemented and open to retaliation. Charles would become a prize target, with only a small shield in Ethan. Charles is death would leave Edward's oath null, returning his rights as heir.\nBefore any of this Charles had already shown his dissent. Their father was mad with rage at the foreign army's refusal. The foreign army had shown no desire to take their kingdom, but required passage through their lands to reach the far west. The King, having heard of their coming, sent a minor brigade to refuse them passage without toll and fealty to the King's right of dominion.\nThe foreign army slaughtered the brigade, having interpreted the group of knights as a threat. They would send their own messengers to the King, carrying the heads of his knights. The foreign army would not acknowledge the King, but granted him mercy. They would pass through without disruption, as long as the messengers returned to them by the following nightfall. If they did not return, the foreign army was prepared to annihilate the King and his people.\nEdward kept his opinions to himself, while Charles expressed distaste in his father's choice to send the brigade in the first place. He warned his father that it would only end in trouble, and to allow the foreign army passage without interruption. Aware of the foreign army's capabilities, as heard through the various rumors, Charles knew lives would be saved if they avoided a confrontation. Nevertheless, the King's arrogance would not allow the foreign army to waltz through his domain without a showing of subservience.\nTheir father was mad, ignorant, and cared naught for the people in these final years. When their father called for the messengers heads Charles protested while Edward quietly observed. The messengers did not plead for their lives, but merely said, \"The Prince is wise. His actions will save the lives of your people. Yours would erase your existence from history. No *true* King fails to grace the pages of history.\" Moments later the King would have Ethan take their heads and add them to the pile they brought.\nSoon thereafter, Edward took his oath and relinquished his title without any consultation. Charles could not fathom his actions. The King had planned to send nearly their entire army to their deaths, including his sons, and his brother would abandon him like a coward. Charles' disgust with Edward would soon turn to hatred.\nWhispers claimed that Edward had sent the lieutenant from his personal guard to the foreigners. He would carry an offer of fealty to the foreign Emperor, once they had massacred his brothers and remaining soldiers, in return for sparing the remaining Kingdom under his own name. The whispers came from the torture of Edward's lieutenant, after Ethan captured him while the kingdom's army made their way towards the foreign army.\nCharles, having learned of this betrayal, would leave Ethan in charge and return to court. \"Father's madness infects Edward's blood,\" Charles believed. \"I cannot allow this to carry on any further,\" he resolved. Charles would seek to have his father relinquish the crown and thus allow him to attempt peace with the foreign Emperor.\nUpon returning to the throne Charles was met by his father, seated and drowning himself with wine, with his brother at his side broad sword in hand planted downward into the marble dais. \"You send your people to death! Your sons to their graves, while you feed your madness with wine!?\" Charles refused to hold his tongue any longer, the court quieted and the air was suddenly thick with tension. The King looked crookedly at his enraged offspring. Charles continued, \"And you! You conspire against me!? If you wished for the throne all you need was ask! We could have spared innocent lives if you simply spoke with me! We could have avoided needless bloodshed if you could overcome your cowardice!\" His anger with his brother was beyond that with his father, but his bond with his twin was of a different magnitude. Edward remained quiet, tightening his grip on the hilt of his broad sword, his armor shifting slightly.\n\"You, you dare...\" the King began but paused. \"...You are a seed not worthy of my words, but I am a merciful King...However I will not poison the hearts of the people with our discourse. Empty the court! I will have words with my son that no one need witness.\" Momentarily Charles' tension left him, believing he had a chance to break through to his father while the court emptied. The King looked to Edward, \"you as well my boy, I have no desire to embarrass your brother any further.\" Edward protested, but the King's sapphire eyes turned cold on him, and he made his way out.\nOnce the court was empty, Charles took a few steps towards the throne, \"Father.. I'm sorry for my anger but --\"\n\"Sorry!? How dare you speak before me! How dare you call me 'Father'! I am your King child! You will refer to me as such and nothing else!\" The King stood, looking down towards his son, incensed with hatred.\nCharles made another attempt, \"...Your highness, I plead tha --\"\n\"You PLEAD!? I did not empty this court for you to plead! Silence your tongue before I rip your throat from its godforsaken shell!\"\nCharles' anger began to boil once again, realizing his father was beyond reason. He remained silent.\n\"You are a son of mine no longer. Your rights are removed, and with Edward's oath Ethan will be well protected. You will return to the vanguard and give your life for your King! If your bones do not come back in pieces I will break them MYSELF before EVER laying my dirt atop you!\" The King was far gone. There was no repair for this sort, Charles knew."

We each wanted to make sure the other wouldn't hunt humans down to extinction, extinguishing our food source and damning both species.\nThen, we realized it was foolish to waste our time and energy fighting over a resource that was expanding by leaps and bounds. Neither vampire nor werewolf grew to a large extent as a community. The process to bare new members was stressful and didn't always achieve success. Humans, on the other hand, needed no prodding or help to procreate, producing members constantly.\nThat was when it was decided that vampires and werewolves could coexist with little issue. We were immortals who could run our little worlds with resources that we had accrued over centuries. It made life good. It made us weak.\nZombies had been around as long as werewolves and vampires. The walking carrion were of no consequence to us, a runt species that was easily ignored. Early humans dealt with them easily enough that numbers were inconsequential. We'd even thought that they were extinct for the last two centuries.\nLife became easier for humans. Their numbers swelled to seven billion. Seven billion plump cattle, comfortable to the point of ignorance. Our numbers were so manageable and their lives so disposable, it was a veritable paradise. We became idle.\nThe zombies, whom we thought were distant memories, took advantage of the same population boom and oblivious society that we were also guilty of. They started to spring up in population centers. We thought that the humans would take care of the issue themselves, they had made who knows how many movies about them, how could they not figure out how to put down the issue? They failed, just as we did. We were more than capable of snuffing it out early on. Our hubris was another contributing factor to our downfall.\nNow, humanity is gone, the buffet is closed. I sit here in this bunker with a singular werewolf. She is weak. She has not fed in weeks. Many of her kin have destroyed themselves, much like mine did, rather than face starvation. I could have done the same. I wish I had done the same, much like my rigor companion probably wishes.\nNow, religions touted eternal life as a glorious reward. Our two species have found a way to make it into a damnable punishment.\nEdit: Spacing"

Maybe it was out of a fear of being alone in the universe. What ever it was, what ever purpose we had for searching, had led us to this. This was the fate of humanity.\nI think it is 9:00, 9:30? Who knows what time it currently is, let alone whether it was dusk or dawn. Every time I wake up, I hope that what happened was just a really, really messed up dream, and every time it is the same as the day before. Still shackled to this metal plate, while they pump the blood from my veins to fuel their addictions. Fortunately, I am O+. That means that they don't just squeeze me dry and discard my corpse like some sort of twisted version of a capri-sun. But instead, they just take a couple of liters at a time, allowing me to enjoy my misery until I \"expire\" like a carton of milk. Maybe it is because of the rarity of my blood. That's probably why. They don't just keep humans alive for this long for no reason. All I know is that my blood is the most potent, the most expensive, the most enjoyable and the most precious blood type in the known galaxy.\nSure, it is illegal for them to do this but this place just falls short of the federation's border. That means any human here is fair game. Or maybe this place is within the border, yet again, lets not get any hopes up. The chances of being rescued is minimal. I try to move into a more comfortable position, yet all this does is cause a sharp pain to ripple through my ribs, signifying that I have triggered the pumps to start doing their job. As my vision starts to clear, I am greeted with the familiar sight of various clear tubes, filled with blood, running out of my abdomen and off to a large pipeline where our blood is sent off to God knows where.\nEvery time I wake up, I don't say every day as there is no way of telling the time in this place, I turn my head to the left and right to see how my fellow \"cattle\" are doing. And every time I am greeted to the same sight. Columns of people hooked up to this infernal machine, sucking them dry with every passing second. Millions of them, if not thousands, in eternal pain.\nBut something was off. Not as many people where dying and being released into the depths of the facility to be disposed of. Instead, it seemed like the pump was slowing down, as the shooting pain had dulled. The usually high pitched whir of the pump had changed to slow hum. Then a loud crackling came over the loud speaker.\n\"Attention,\" stated a commanding voice.

One of the most well reserved planets in the galaxy. This is mostly due to a lack of societal advancement. The humans, earth's most advanced species, have at least acquired some forms of tier one technology. But it is a far cry from even the impoverished sector RR-4.\nAh, here is a very curious subgroup of the human species, the northern american. It walks along the designated 'concrete': a primitive form of infrastructure, composed mainly of water and sand. The human navigates as best he can, narrowly avoiding other humans and occasionally bumping in to one, not unlike the flightless one-eyed Yipps on planet Voranus.\nIt enters a structure through glass panels and engages with another human at an arrangement of wood and marble. A transaction is made. A few rectangular cloths are traded for a container of liquid. This is a hot substance and of very low sustenance. It is still widely debated why the humans consume such a liquid.\nSome of the liquid spills out as the human nearly trips over an obstruction. Humans are known to have below average motor functions, however, this one seems particularly clumsy. It sets itself down at a wooden arrangement along with its steaming liquid and its tier one electronic device. It begins working the device with eight of its ten digits.\nAh, it begins typing, which is electronic writing. This is its redeeming quality. It is the closest humans have come to the standard cognition level of the rest of the galaxy. They, obviously, still are a long ways off. As you can see, it has paused.

The ground was muddy, the wind blew hard, and in the far distance he could see a river. He could hear trumpets, he could hear roaring, but only softly so. Nobody was around him, though he wore heavy armour along with a sword and shield, as well as a helmet. A lone warrior was an uncommon thing. He placed his hand on the helmet. Phrygian? He guessed he was in a battle, but he couldn't see the men around him. Sometimes he thought he saw faint ghastly visions of a magnificant army with grand pikes marching past him, but they weren't real, just figments of his imagination.\nAcross him was an Indian. He marched confidently, but without as much armour. India? He looked at his hands. White as could be. Odd.\nHe marched forwards as well, but then stopped. He didn't know why he had marched forward or stopped. The Indian stopped as well, but after a short pause he roared and charged at him. He could hear orders being faintly shouted and the sound of a massive stampede coming towards him.\nThe Indian charged blindly, without much sense.

I thought frat parties were a means with which the patriarchy oppresses women. Not really your scene, Emma.\"\n\"Can you not? Just because I'm a gender studies major, my god. I like parties. Parties are fun.\"\n\"You still having fun at 3:30 am?\"\n\"Nah, just waiting around to sober up. What's your excuse?\"\n\"Oh\u2026 I'm always up this late.\"\n\"Are you serious?! Like every weekend?\"\n\"Every day, actually. I don't really do sleep.\"\n\"Rob. How is that even possible?! You play varsity sports, you're in my 8 am physics lab\u2026\"\n\"I survive.\"\n\"Good to know my friend's either a superhero or a cyborg.\"\n**II**\n\"Emma?\"\n\"Yeah. \u2026you okay, Rob?\"\n\"Can we go to my room?\"\n\"Why, cause you need someone to take care of you after you puke, or cause you want to hook up? Either way, probably not my favorite thing to do.\"\n\"Neither, I promise. I just want to\u2026show you something.\"\n\"Okay. Are you sure nothing's wrong? Now I'm scared there's a dead body in your bathroom or something.\"\n\"Nothing like that. You just have to promise to never tell anyone else.\"\n\"\u2026I promise.\"\n**III**\n\"Shit, Rob, what's making it glow?\"\n\"Me.\"\n\"What? How?\"\n\"It's always been like this. Literally never stops glowing unless I take it off. Why do you think I never wore it?\"\n\"I\u2026I thought you just wanted to look like a daredevil.\"\n\"I'm not a daredevil, Emma.\"\n\"Look, it's got to be a mistake. Send it back. Have it tested.\"\n\"Did that in second grade. That was when my parents got me a dog.\"\n\"\u2026this means, means you're going to\u2026\"\n\"Kill myself, yes. Apparently so.\"\n\"No. That's not possible. You're Rob. You wouldn't choose to kill yourself.\"\n\"I know it's possible. I see it happen every time I go to sleep. Cliffs, ropes, pills, guns. My subconscious is persistent, if not creative.\"\n\"Oh god. That's why you don't sleep.\"\n\"Bingo.\"\n\"You, you can't let it freak you out like this. It'll probably be...when you're really old, you know. Like you're really old and Alzheimer's is starting to set in and you want to end it on your own terms. There's nothing wrong with that, right?\"\n\"I don't know, Emma.\"\n\"I don't know either.\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\"Me too.\"\n**IV**\n*Emma woke up disoriented. She was in a bed, but not hers. Rob's? She vaguely remembered tears and hugs and drifting in and out of wakefulness. Someone had covered her with a blanket and taken off her shoes. Rob's room, yes. He was already gone, probably off on a morning walk. His bracelet sat on the desk, inches from her face, glowing faintly. So he wasn't close. Maybe at the gym, or getting coffee, but it didn't matter. Emma watched the red light slowly grow brighter. Quietly, with a sense of peace, she removed her own bracelet, dull gray as always, and left it on the desk. On her own wrist she slipped Rob's bracelet, and as it began to grow brighter, she straightened the bedcovers and left. *"

          "inputText": "Sergeant Clark lifted his wrist to look at the band wrapped around it. It was no different than the fitness trackers people wore, except that it was reinforced by thick ropes of steel. It looked boring, actually. Black, some kind of supple rubber. A little digital heart pulsed consistently beside of a number that read 96. A cold blade of panic pierced his back, shooting a chill up his neck and across his scalp. He swallowed against an entirely too-dry throat, feeling the tissue scrape across itself like sandpaper. The sensation gagged him and he had to suppress his body's reflex to retch.\nHe managed to tear his eyes from his own wrist to a face concealed by a mask without contour or color. \"You have 60 seconds. If your heart still beats after, the nuclear bombs will launch. It doesn't matter what countries will be hit. What matters is the one that fired them. The USA.\"\nIt was strange where his mind went as he targeted the stranger with the barrel of his gun. He thought of how he'd never have a dog. His parents would never let him have one of his own growing up and life had never given him the opportunity to bring one into his life as an adult, between never having an apartment that allowed him as he failed out of college, and all of the travel required by his secret career. He didn't think of Lucy or his mom. He thought of this dog, that probably would have been brown and white or something and ate its own vomit. He would've named it Daniels, because Jack would've raised some brows with the reputation Sergeant Clark had made for himself.\nHands numb, he lowered the barrel of his gun. The number on the wristband was nearing 200. He felt disconnected from his body other than his nose, which was ice cold. He closed his eyes and smiled. He didn't know what was funny, but he couldn't deny that something was. He relaxed his shoulders, let the rifle fall slack on its strap across his chest, and pulled his pistol from its holster on his hip. The metal should've been cold against his temple, but he wouldn't have noticed it had it not been for the determined pressure of it. Almost forgetting them, Sergeant Clark turned to face his squad. Why? He wasn't sure. Maybe to say he was sorry. Maybe to thank them for his time with them the last five years. Maybe it was so the last thing he saw before he died was a familiar face, if not a friend.\nInstead, what he saw was the barrels of five guns with highly trained fingers on the triggers. He was glad he couldn't see their eyes.\nSergeant Clark holstered his pistol in a practiced, mechanical movement and gave a short nod that was both an order, a pardon, and an apology all at the same time.\n__\nEdit: Spelling"

          "inputText": "The room sat several thousands of people, centered around an holographic display on a stage. No one needed to present, one person was in charge of moving the holographs around, revealing dozens of images of the worlds beyond this solar system.\nNo man has ever set foot beyond Jupiter, yet they managed to send five-hundred thousand robots to fly to other solar systems in the galaxy. Why waste a life or a few thousands just to fly in space of nothing for a few several hundred months when they could send robots who can do the job just as well, if not better and faster?\nOn these displays held the attention of all in the room. Only a team of four people had seen them before, and now many thousands will see them for the first time. All the robots had reached their destinations and discovered a few worlds in each system. The robots were sent to solar systems containing Earth-like planets and have them investigate the surface of these places.\nPeople began to murmur when they saw a tower on planet Gaea. The murmuring increased as more buildings revealed themselves on other planets. Several dozen of planets appeared and disappeared in the air on the holographic display. Each planet stayed in the air for five minutes, zooming in closer to the surface and out to see the entire planet again.\nThe last planet faded from view two hours later, and the room fell silent again, most people shocked and stunned by what they saw.\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" one person asked in the front row seat. A scientist who helped launch the robots.\nLike a spell, the room burst into loud conversations\u2014debates, expressions of shock, questions being asked, and no response could satisfy them all.\nA loud gonging sound rang through the stadium seating style room, and the audience fell into a hushed whispers, unable to stop themselves from discussing the planets they viewed.\n\"This, ladies and gentlemen, is the proof that we are not alone,\" he said, showing one planet. As he continued to talk, the planet rotated. \"The thing is, all of these planets show the buildings in ruin. No one is alive. They're all dead planets.\"\n\"But why are they all in ruins? How do we know for sure they are not hiding?\"\n\"We have been examining the planets for a year,\" he answered. \"There have been no movement. On all 428 planets. Of the 500 we sent, only 72 did not make it to their destinations. Of the 52 planets, there were no ruins found. The rest\u2026 376 planets, they all had buildings\u2014as you saw them. Houses, large buildings, towers, roads. Even pools. Yet, none of them had anyone walk around. Drive a vehicle. There are, however, life forms, animals if you will, moving around. Acting the very same way Earth's animals move to eat, to fight, and to sleep. They are not intelligent as they never used any of the buildings for themselves.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I present you another evidence. They all committed suicide. Mass suicides.\"\nHe pressed a button and it zoomed in to a building. The people could clearly see bodies on the ground outside the building, each of them holding a weapon very similar to a gun and aimed at themselves.\nAnother image showed similar scene, bodies with weapons aimed at themselves. The bodies on both planets were skeletons. The animals had not gotten to them on any of the planets.\nThe crowd was silent again.\n\"Does this mean\u2026 whatever happened to them, will happen to us?\" the same questioner asked.\n\"That, sir, is the question we want to ask. The real questions are: why? What happened? How? What can we do to prevent this from happening? Anyone have a guess?\"\nThe place was quiet, waiting for some brave soul to answer. Three minutes, still no one stepped forward to hazard a guess.\n\"Lucky for you, I do have the answers to them,\" he said, his expression growing grave as he continued to talk. \"What is amazing is not the ruins themselves, or the bodies. Or the fact that we are not alone. What is amazing is what drove them to killing themselves. Every last,\" he switched to another planet, \"one,\" another planet, \"of,\" another planet, \"these have been threatened with the space ships that came to them.\"\nA final holographic displayed showed a fleet of space ships flying past Jupiter.\n\"They are slave traders. We have one week before they get here.\"\nThe room burst with anger words spewing out their feelings at this. Some of disbelief, of outrage, of despair.\n\"We know this,\" his voice grew louder to be heard over the din, \"because we found 38 planets with ruins and they have shown no bodies like the others do.\"\nThe room fell silent again, his words silenced the skeptics.\n\"We have no option, we must kill ourselves before we become slaves to some\u2026 some aliens. I am quite certain we will not enjoy being slaves.\"\n\u2014\nThe fleet of ships landed on Earth. The doors opened on all spacecrafts. The people within stepped out, looking around and stared at the bodies with dismay.\n\"Not another one! Why do they keep killing themselves just before we could get here to make peace talks? Does no one in the galaxy want to do business in selling and exchanging fruits?\"\n\"I don't know, it's a shame\u2026 I saw on the monitors that they seem to have some tasty fruits here\u2026\" a guy said, walking to stand next to the first person.\nThe first person sighed, shaking his head. \"I guess we'll raid all the fruits and their seeds and move on. I hate this place, just like the rest.\"\nThe group was silent for a moment.\n\"Well, let's get gathering, men and women,\" the second man said."

          "inputText": "\"Shit,\" I muttered. I woke up late for work again today. My paranoia has been settling in recently. My eyes remain glued to the television for hours watching the news every day. I'm losing sleep over it. The Russians have flooded to us here in the U.S. and China has claimed Antarctica, shipping missiles over to it, to presumably launch from should anything trigger a nuclear response from them.\nThe Russians have been coming over in droves for about twenty years now. There has been a resource crisis going on for five. Do they know something?\nI hopped in my car to go to work and turned on the radio. On the highway I hit traffic, of course. Dead stop. The radio gets an interruption with an emergency broadcast. The Russians have began isolated attacks in the U.S.\nNow I don't know if I'm sitting in traffic or fear.\nI put down my window and peek out to see if I can see anything causing this traffic when a huge blast about seven cars ahead shattered my windshield and knocked me out.\nI awoke what was probably twenty minutes later.\nDisoriented, I open my eyes. A huge pillar of smoke is reaching the top of the trees that border the highway. This is when I feel a severe pain in my arm. I look at it and notice a bend in my forearm, it's badly broken. My car has slid back a good fifteen feet and is now crooked. About a minute later my hearing is starting to return but is still muffled. The first sounds I heard was screaming. It looks like other cars around me got it much worse. There was a larger car in front of me that may have shielded some of the blast.\nI step out of my car and look towards the billowing smoke. There are about five men equipped with what looks like automatic rifles standing near the origin of the flames. I can't see anything else besides this.\n\"Are they military?\" I thought.\nWhen I got back in my car I started it up again without any problems. I guess this will be the only good thing to happen today.\nI begin to drive through the wreckage of other cars carefully. All their windows were blown out as well. Peering into some vehicles I didn't see a lot of motion. I was telling myself they were all just knocked out like I was, but I knew otherwise. When I got closer to where the blast originated I saw a charred car. The men holding the rifles saw me driving and ordered me to stop. There's a lot of firepower there so I wasn't taking any chances.\nThey asked me with what sounded like a Russian accent, \"How much gas you have in tank?\"\n\"I'm at a quarter of a tank full.\" I reply. I never really get too much in there because of prices now and the shortage. Did they want to leave the scene?\nI glanced to my right and saw one of the other guys with them pull out a hose from a backpack and open another cars' gas door. He began syphoning their gas into a tank of their own. He was going car to car doing this.\nI was snapped back to attention when I heard, \"Give us what we want and no problems, okay?\"\n\"Okay\" naturally comes out when you have a gun in your face and asked a question like this.\nOne of the others walked up to him and whispered something to him. All I saw was a head nod in response. That's when I started hearing the unmistakable sound of gunshots. They were killing any witnesses.\nIn a panic I ducked down below the steering wheel and slammed the gas. I definitely hit the guy that was holding me hostage as well as pin-balling off of some cars along the way. I heard my car getting hit by their fire.\nI got off the next exit and started heading back home. How I made it out of there I'll never know.\nNow is not the time for thinking, now is the time for preparation. This has only just begun."

Do not accept *anything* said here as fact regarding the human genome, although certain individual parts may be correct.\n---\nThere have always been portions of the human genome that don't seem to actually affect anything. A few years back, when the bill that allowed gene modification on fertilized human embryos was passed, several other geneticists and I went *crazy* changing these. It didn't seem to do a thing. Even if we put *random* data in those \"cruft\" (as we called them) parts, the people would turn out the same. But recently, I had noticed something interesting. Since I used to be a computer scientist, before I became a geneticist, the way I look at things is sometimes very different from that of my colleagues, and recently I had started comparing different people's genomes. What's the difference between the genome of a tall, white, blonde, blue-eyed white woman, and a short, dark-haired, brown-eyed black man? Again and again, every time, only one thing was consistent between *everyone*. The cruft. So I logged into the international database of human genetics and used up all of my queries for the year (it's kind of sickening, actually: there's a set limit on the number of queries you can make per year to the website, and then it's based off of microtransactions) comparing the cruft on 16,774 different human genomes. All the same. Perhaps it was just coincidence, but I had to be sure. I loaded up the entirety of the cruft into one file, and looked at it. It looked...normal. Random. It looked like DNA. Then, by a sudden sudden burst of inspiration, I ran a reverse-base4 one it. The resultant file was, apparently, a standards-compliant ISO file? That didn't sound right. I mounted it and looked inside. There was a single file, named `README.txt`, and a single folder, named `src/`. What the hell was this witchcraft?\nDNA (1) TempleOS General Commands Manual DNA (1)\nNAME\ndna \u2014 compiles.and files to usable genomes\nSYNOPSIS\ndna [-adho] [-t | -w] [-L linkpath] [-O outputdevice]\n[-m arch [: machine]] [-p [eprtv]] filename...\nDESCRIPTION\nThe dna compiler will, given a creation-dev-ice of at least version 2.7.4, compile a\ngenome from one or multiple.and files and use the creation-dev-ice to bootstrap any\nnumber of \"starter\" animals.\nBUGS\nNo known bugs\nCOPYRIGHT\nThis compiler and man page are copyright (c) 0-\u221e A.D under the HPL (Holy Public\nLicence), Jehova & Baelzebub enterprises, LTD., in cooperation with RedHat\nsoftware LLC.\nHuh. I looked inside `src/`, which contained the source code to this \"dna\" program, and according to the parser...a \"creation-dev-ice\" was identical to one of our modern 3-D printers!\nI knew it was expensive, and I was just a poor lab-worker, but I didn't care. I had to try this software out. I shelled out for the most expensive 3-D printer I could find, hooked it up to my computer, and ran the dna program on `example.and`, in `src/`. It gave me various messages as it ran, and eventually the 3-D printer started up. And it was *loud*. I had tested it out a few times before, and it had been relatively loud, but not as loud as this. I didn't dare leave it alone long enough to go to the store and buy some ear plugs, but I desperately wanted to. My computer began to get visibly hot, despite being state-of-the-art liquid-nitrogen-cooled. I shielded my eyes and looked right at the bottom of the screen, where the indicator read 90% finished. Almost...almost...you can do it. Until two error messages showed up in bright red:\nERROR: Operating system is not TempleOS. Unable to link properly.\nERROR: Running temperature is not 98.549\u00b0F. Deforming product.\nAnd what stepped out of the 3-D printer a few seconds a later is a monstrosity I will not bear to describe. Suffice to say it was the most awful, ferocious, disgusting beast known to mankind. With all the intelligence of a human, with none of the conscience; with all the ferociousness of the tiger, with none of the discretion. And five more such as these stepped out of the printer. I shrieked and ran.\n---\nPart 2 coming when I get a chance."

          "inputText": "The telescope was patterned with verdigris and fingerprints, but the brass was still bright.\nIt had belonged to Robin's grandfather and her grandmother had set it up for her on the rural porch, preparing for the orbiting object. The young girl had done the mathematics herself, figuring out where in the sky the satellite would fly by and helping her grandmother's spidery, blue-veined hands to get the old instrument at the correct azimuth.\n\"I polished the lens,\" the old woman said as she gazed up into the clear night sky, \"you can see Sirius clear as day.\"\nRobin nodded and flipped though her notes, her auburn eyebrows drawn together in worry.\n\"I hope I got this right.\"\nHer grandfather's pocket watch sat nearby, ticking resolutely. They had another ten minutes before it was due to breach the horizon.\nThe old woman draped a shawl around her granddaughter's shoulders; it was cold and the girl hadn't dressed warmly - she was flushed with excitement and the heady thrill of adventure.\n*Is this a mistake? *\nThe thought came unbidden to the grandmother's mind. Was she a fool to encourage activities like this? Her own mother - were she still alive - would be sniping at her about encouraging girls to be dreamers, not homemakers.\nBut the old woman remembered her own dreams at Robin's age - selfish dreams of inventing electric devices, of making circuits of copper and batteries, exploring the seemingly unlimited potential of the new age of electricity.\n\"Grandma,\" the girl began, \"do you think they'll ever put a man in space?\"\nThe matriarch gave a frail smile,\n\"I don't doubt it child; it is only a matter of time and money I'd say.\"\nRobin pursed her lips, wondering if she should ask the next question.\nDetecting the reluctance of her granddaughter, she wrapped her thin arms around the child's shawl-draped shoulders in reassurance.\n\"Grandma,\" Robin licked her lips,\n\"Yes little one?\"\n\"Do you...do you think they'll ever put a *woman* in space?\"\nEven though she'd known the question was coming, the old woman known as Jolene sucked in a sudden breath, a curious *pang* touching her heart.\n\"I don't know,\" she admitted with bald-faced honesty - the kind she didn't normally use around children.\nThey sat in silence for the remaining four minutes, watching the hands of the pocket watch tick around the mother-of-pearl face.\nAs the moment arrived, the girl pressed her eye to the telescope and watched intently.\nFor a few precious seconds, she saw a dim, moving light rise through the lens - then it was gone from her view.\nWith a whoop of joy she leaped up from the wicker chair and hugged her grandmother around the middle,\n\"I *saw it* Grandma! I saw *Sputnik! *\"\nHolding her granddaughter close, the old woman smiled. The girl had calculated everything correctly; her mathematical precision was uncanny for a nine-year-old.\n\"Come inside Robin,\" she said, \"your hands are frozen.\"\nLeaving her dead husband's telescope on the porch, she took the child's hand and led her back inside."

          "inputText": "\"It's a combination of multiple things. You can't expect your font to look professional if you constantly use slang. It puts you in the wrong mindset. Push the vowels, don't mumble. We'll start with an easy power phrase. Repeat after me: 'I'm the boss here.\"'\nThe professor scanned the room and looked for fine details in the text that came up as they spoke together. The class had a size limit so he could see each of his student's text as they ticked on display word by word. The sentences hovered steady above their heads, each in varying thickness and size.\n\"Blue shirt, Alyssa right? Your font is a bit small. You want to hear it louder in your mind, show us you're not afraid. You wrote you were a Prosecutor in your introduction post if I remember correctly. You've got to show the jury you know what you're talking about. Show me some strength.\" He flexed his bicep to accentuate the point.\nEach of his students was aiming to learn for their unique purposes. Richard left side was a weatherman who needed a cleaner font for the cameras. Heather dead center was a petite nurse whose patients took one look at her thin, bubbly font and proceeded to ignore all of her professional advice. Font shaping was a useful skill taken alongside rhetoric and speech to give people a new sense of power in their voice. Color theory stayed in the music department where conductors could chisel delicate blue or shocking pink fonts from the more talented.\n\"New phrase everyone. All together now, 'I'm in control. Listen to me.\"' He articulated carefully to hit all of the key points he skimmed over in his lesson.\nProfessor Barker didn't expect much of a change from each phrase. First day lessons were only to set up class dynamics and give a few examples to the students so they would how an everyday class might go, plus answering syllabus questions. Again he screened over each font and took in the styles, focusing on the general strengths and weaknesses like a chef would inspect his fresh ingredients before a recipe.\nHe noticed the young brunette in the far back right, lips sealed at each prompt. It wasn't uncommon for a student to be shy about their font, especially since attending his class implied there were some things to fix about it. He privately pinged her desk - \"Don't be afraid to join in, you can even use a quiet font for right now. Nobody will see but me, and I promise I won't judge.\"\nHe instructed the class through another set of phrases and kept a curious eye on her. He didn't want to hone in too intently and intimidate her even more, so he lazily scanned the room and paused over her font for a brief moment. And wow.\nHe'd never seen anything like it.. The way the words flowed into one another elegantly, all connected like vines growing into one another. The lines themselves were thin like a woman's fine eyeliner. The g's and y's looped in a way that wasn't bubbly but had a confident layer of something mysterious, feminine, ancient.\nShe saw the way his eyes lit up at her repetition. She whispered and he knew by the volume that it was meant only for him. The letters twirled above her.\n\"It's called cursive.\""

          "inputText": "Ellie didn't know what she was fighting for.\nActually, that was strictly untrue. She know precisely what she was fighting for, and it definitely wasn't any of the things that the politicians on either Mars or Earth were talking about. She was fighting to stay alive; nothing more, nothing less. Richie and Lamont had lost that fight just a few hours ago. Bell, fearless, draconian, red-faced pixie-cut Bell, had lost that fight less than an hour ago. Ellie briefly remembered her cries, her groans, and her final pleading with her communicator to please connect with her daughter one more time. She had been fairly sure that the captain didn't feel pain, but Bell had barely been in one piece after the proximity mine exploded. The dissolving of Bell's normally iron exterior surprised her; in another situation, Ellie might have been touched by the scene, but this was not such an other situation. Ellie ignored the captain's words, and in her mind they blended into the background noise. They were just another hum of the generators, just another hiss of the ventilation system, just another buzz of the lights. Thinking back, she thought she heard the captain beg her to please take a message to her daughter, but she didn't remember. Just another hum.\nShe followed her training. She scavenged supplies from the captain's corpse. It was breathing and moving and talking, but a corpse it was, at least as far as Ellie was concerned. She took ammo, mess kits, and first aid supplies. She took a canister of oxygen, a utility knife, and a flashlight. She took many things, but no memories. When Ellie inevitably followed in Bell's and Richie's and Lamont's and Brandon's and Paris'and Kenna's and the rest's footsteps, nobody would remember her either. It didn't matter that she didn't remember them.\nEllie didn't know what she was fighting for, and she didn't care. She didn't know anything about the two humans in red she had shot dead fifteen minutes ago, and she forgot everything she had learned about the history of the Mars colonies, she just knew how and where to shoot them. She didn't know how the screeching rifles the Whites and Reds pointed at each other worked, she just knew how to use it to make the Reds stop using theirs. She didn't know how and why the deadly proximity mines in Martian Immigrant Complex 7 were placed, she just knew how to spot them and dodge them. She had tried to warn Bell about the one that she triggered, but the captain was distracted by her thoughts and didn't react fast enough. Ellie didn't have any such thoughts or distractions, not anymore. Ellie just survived. She would survive as long as she was better than her enemies at surviving.\nEllie moved quickly through MIC7. The complex had been abandoned entirely by civilians, and the United Nations vanguard had driven the defenders back and held more than half of the structure, at \"heavy casualties\". Ellie didn't worry about the casualties. Either she was one of them and didn't have to worry about it or she was not and could not afford to.\nShe didn't continue towards her objective, planting explosives in a generator room not so far away. She checked to make sure that her communicator was, in fact, not working. She turned down a side hallway in the cramped complex, one of the hallways that led to many places, but were known to not have cameras. She looked for the familiar black glint of cameras and scanned the room with infrared, and found nothing. She stopped, and listened. They had eliminated the last guard patrol that was supposed to be in this area not so long ago, and she had picked off two stragglers on her own fifteen minutes ago. The chances of any more enemies along this particular shortcut route were almost none, but you could never be too sure. She listened, and listened again, and heard nothing.\nShe was alone. And probably safe.\nShe looked down the hallway for the least suspicious looking room. The hall had several unmarked doors that seemed to be utility closets of various kinds, and a few machine rooms.\n*Where would an ambush be? Where would wounded hide? * She thought that the wounded would hide in one of the closets, in as low a place as possible, covered in something. An ambush would probably hide in the machine room near the intersection of two hallways, to be able to make sure their targets actually passed by them.\nShe slipped into the machine room near the center of the hallway. She briefly glanced at the label on the door, but didn't recognize the language. Some kind of oxygen system. It didn't matter.\nAll the lights were off in non-essential areas as the Reds were conserving their power for the war. Ellie shone her flashlight around, pistol in hand, ready to pull the trigger at a moment's notice. She almost did when she passed over a vaguely humanoid metal pipe, but managed to stop her finger, which wanted to shoot at anything and everything.\nThe room was clear. She passed over it one more time to be sure, then pointed her flashlight up. The apparatus was in several large pieces, and it would be difficult to see on top of any of them from the door. She picked the second furthest one, and started climbing. She realized her tired her limbs were as she pulled herself slowly up the gently vibrating metal exoskeleton, but simple tiredness seemed almost an irrelevant problem at this point. She forced herself upward, and soon crawled on top.\nShe spread out a self-expanding bedroll and a foil light-absorbing sheet. It wouldn't be much good if anyone turned on the lights, but there wouldn't be much she could do in that situation anyway. She rummaged around in the various kits she had picked up for sleeping pills, guaranteed to be fast and dreamless. Her own had run out a long time ago, but it seemed a few of her squadron hadn't been too keen on the pills. She found a bottle, popped it open, and took three, two-and-a-half more than was recommended.\nShe closed her eyes and found herself quickly drifting off to sleep. As is the way with humans, it was at these times that our thoughts, memories, and conscience always catch up with us, and despite her best efforts, Ellie was yet human. Luckily, she could feel the pills taking over, but in those brief, lucid moments, she allowed herself to think.\nHer squadron's mission would be temporarily abandoned; she would have been expected to continue or report, of course, but after being ambushed, losing their entire squadron over two days, and being forced into the underground section of one of the MICs, where communication was difficult to establish, would probably be good enough to get her out of tribunal. At least in MIC7, the victory of the United Nations force was almost inevitable, and Ellie only had to wait half a day or so, maybe at most a day, until the area was secured. Maybe she could shoot herself in the leg or something and get sent home\u2026not that there was any way to get home from this hellish planet at the moment.\nAn image sprang into her mind. Lamont's face, a round, brown face with a scruffy black beard on a thin muscular man, constantly wearing a smile. Lamont would have taken a power nap at most and continued on the mission, probably solo, especially now that the area was known to be clear. He only had to plant a few explosive charges, after all. Lamont was a hero in everything he did. On Earth, he probably would have been the waiter who went the extra mile and a half to make sure a customer's lost order was fixed up, or the accountant who stood up against a corrupt vice president and fought a five-year long losing battle in the name of justice. On Mars, he got shot in the left arm, torso, and lower abdomen, because he was not correctly behind cover.\nLamont was a hero. Ellie was not a hero; Ellie was alive and in one piece. As sleep took her, she dreamed of herself sitting back on a sofa in her tiny living room, wrapped in a blanket, cold soda in her hands, and listening to soft piano.\nShe smiled in her dreamy state, the first time she smiled in God knows how long.\n*Let's just go home and listen to classical music. *"

I hate when people touch me, tease me, or rub their elbow against my own. It makes the back of my head hurt.\nAnd as usual, Marcella took notice of me standing sheepishly near the doorway, and nodded to me with the faintest hint of a smile. She was the only one besides Lou, who moved to a school with a better autism support program, who ever smiled at me in school. I liked that about her.\nBub stood from his desk, walked to stand next to me. \"What are you doing?\"\nI turned to look at him, meeting his eyes for a second, before deciding that it would be easier for me to just look at his nose while we talked. \"I'm standing here.\" I said.\n\"I mean,\" he had the deepest voice I'd ever heard, \"why?\"\nI looked at his shoes. They were green, black, and white, and had a picture of Michael Jordan's silhouette on the side. They were shiny. Mostly, they were weird. \"Your shoes are weird.\" I said back.\nHe laughed. \"Your shoes are Velcro.\"\nI'm not sure why he said that. I think he meant \"normal\".\nI glanced at the doorway again. Now there were only stragglers. \"Well, I have to go.\" I said wryly as I walked out of the room.\nI made a left. Thirty-five linoleum tiles later, I made another left. Twelve linoleum tiles later, I was at Mr. Nancy's class. I walked in, shuffled to my seat, and set my backpack down. I loved Mr. Nancy, even though his last name was a first name, which was a real problem for me at the beginning of the semester. *What is his wife's name? *\nI'll remember, always, the day that Mr. Nancy was telling us about King Xerxes, and I raised my hand to ask what his wife's name is. He laughed for a second, as did the rest of the class. \"It's Faye,\" he chuckled, \"Do you have any questions about Persia?\"\nFaye Nancy. Finance\u2014y. Nonsense words.\nAnyway, on this particular day, Mr. Nancy was talking about the Meddicci family and why they were so important, and I was busy staring at the back of Marcella's head because half of it was freshly shaved, and I was feeling a mix of *please-let-me-touch-it* and *why-did-you-do-that*.\nAnd when Mr. Nancy said this: \"So let's all get into groups,\" I was very, very busy wondering what I had missed, and worrying about my group.\nThe room turned into a beehive for a moment, alive with the buzzing of excited students forming small alliances. I did not move. Mr. Nancy came to my desk, leaning down to ask me quietly, \"Are you okay with that?\"\nI stared at his shaved head, much more naked and shiny than half of Marcella's head. \"Groups?\" I asked back.\n\"Yeah,\" he said, \"Do you want to go to Mrs. Ray's room?\"\nMrs. Ray is the special education teacher who gives me answers on every assignment when I feel stressed. I don't think she's supposed to do this. She may have thought I was stupid.\nMr. Nancy spoke again, \"Or is there a particular partner you'd be comfortable with?\"\nI said quietly, \"Marcella.\"\nHe nodded, smiled, clapped his hands as he walked to the front of the room, behind his desk. \"Alright, guys,\" he bellowed, \"Sorry for the confusion, but these are assigned groups.\"\nEverybody groaned.\nHe broke up the class like teachers do: separating Steve and Andrew because they were so loud together, making sure that Jayme and Nika don't sit too close together because they tend to get distracted, and, finally, assigning me and Marcella into our own team.\nMarcella looked at me and patted the seat next to hers. I came to her and sat. She looked at me in the eyes and I stared at her nose instead. \"Sara, do you know what we're supposed to be doing?\"\nThis brought out a panic in me. I felt my face get hot. \"Being in a group?\"\n\"I mean, like,\" she laughed. \"What are we doing in the group?\"\nI was silent and decided to smile so that she didn't think I was weird.\nShe let out an even bigger laugh and said, \"I don't know either.\"\nShe turned her head and began to text under her desk. I stared at the shaved side of her head.\n\"I like your bald head.\" I blurted out.\nShe looked at me. I don't know what face she was making, but it made the back if my head hurt for a second. Then she smiled and said, \"Thank you,\" only she said it like it was a question.\nI wanted to tell her that it made me happy when she smiled at me in the hallway. I wanted to ask her about her piercings. *Did they hurt? * I wanted to look at her shoes. Then, I realized, I just wanted to be able to make myself say *anything* to her.\nAfter 15 minutes of her playing with her phone, she turned her chair to face me. \"We have to look like we're doing something.\" Then, she swung her mouth to the side before asking me, \"You have a good weekend?\"\n\"Did I have a good weekend.\" I corrected.\n\"Did you?\" She asked.\n\"Did I what?\" I asked back. The back of my head hurt.\nShe stared at me quizzically. *Ow ow ow*.\nI stood, gathered my backpack, and walked back to Mrs. Ray's room."

I was a man with family and peers, coworkers and colleagues. I *was* a good man committing grey sins.\nI didn't notice that they were forgetting at first. I guess when you die, you just expect the souls of those you once knew to be there watching you burn or looking on with envy as you entered paradise. I think when the good men told me of Heaven, and that I would be with all my loved ones, I believe that same thing translated into my existence in hell, but there wasn't. What there was was, though, was another state of being.\nI wasn't Rover Castile here. I was *that* guy. My entire existence was an endless stream of adjectives, but never a single noun. They don't remember me. I quit working for McMeery's Roofing, and they forgot me. I stopped talking to family to make them miss me, but they forgot me. I stopped socializing to make a statement, and everyone forgot me.\nI'm...\nMy name is...\nI had a name. It was a little different, but...\nOh, I forget.

          "inputText": "When the citizens of Indiana went to sleep last night, they were Americans. This morning when they woke up, they belonged to a new country. This bizarre event was made possible by, of all things, an innocent clerical error. A resolution concerning farm subsidies passed by the Indiana legislature had erroneously included a clause separating the state from the union. According to sources in the state government, an intern had inserted that clause as a joke. However, that addition was not spotted during deliberations. Nor was it caught in when it passed through the State House of Representatives. Or the State Senate. Or the Governor's desk.\nNormally this measure would require a popular vote. The unanimous passage, however, overrules that requirement, meaning that the secession is valid. State officials scrambled to correct their mistake, but by then it was too late. In order to regain statehood, the state legislature would need to draft a special ballot measure approved by 2/3 majority that would then need to be approved by a majority of voters. The earliest that the voting could take place is next November. Even that would only shift the action to the United States Congress which would then need to approve statehood for Indiana.\nAlready though, there are obstacles for the Hoosier state. Currently, their departure opens up additional seats in the House of Representatives, seats that the Democrats are eager to reassign or even see removed entirely. The state historically has been a shoo in for GOP candidates, the notable exception being 2012 when comments by GOP Senatorial candidate Robert Mourdock about rape derailed his campaign and gave the election to Democrat Joe Donnelly.\nAlso in the way are the voters themselves. Take Anderson, IN resident Connie Young for example. \"What has the US ever done for us,\" she asks. \"Higher taxes, massive debt. We're better off on our own.\" One of Indiana's largest employers, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, has lobbied the state to suspend actions to regain statehood. Secession lifts the burden imposed by the Healthcare Reform Act, saving the company billions.\nAround the rest of the country, opinions are mixed. Many are claiming that the country is better off without them or at least treat the issue with indifference. In fact, the only people actively lobbying for the state to regain statehood are racing fans. The Powell family from Covington, KY, just across the Ohio River from Indiana bemoan the fact that they now need passports in order to attend the Indy 500, one of the largest racing events in the country. They have attended every Indy 500 for the past 22 years. But this year, they will need to negotiate with the US State Department in order to keep their tradition alive.\nIt is uncertain whether or not Indiana will rejoin the United States and if they will be welcomed back. Whatever happens, though, for the next several months at least, Indiana is it's own nation."

          "inputText": "Ahmed had been under interrogation for a week now without showing any signs of cracking. His beard had been cut off and dark circles had formed around his eyes as a result of sleep deprivation. His fingers had finally scabbed up. They had thought ripping his fingernails out one by one would have been enough to break him, but they didn't know how strong he was. He would die before breaking, he knew this in the depths of his heart.\nAgent Williams was watching Ahmed from behind the one way glass. She saw the look of steely determination in his eyes and knew that this was not going to be an easy task. Sighing, she pulled out her phone and dialled a number. \"Get me Agent Kowalski. We are going to have to use the Madison Protocol.\" A momentary silence followed, before she heard a reply. \"Roger that.\"\nAhmed was blindfolded and led into a room. His arms and legs were chained to a chair. Two agents held him down, while a third agent pried his eyes open. A fourth agent delicately taped Ahmed's eyelids to his face. Ahmed struggled fiercely, but a week of minimal eating had left him weak and unable to resist. Fear gripped the pit of his stomach as something was injected into his arm. He thought, \"What is it that they will subject me to? God have mercy.\"\nA projector whirred into action behind him and the white wall directly ahead of him suddenly came to life with the Touchstone Pictures logo. As a theme song blared from all directions, Ahmed felt at ease. He laughed to himself, \"Movies? This is your big plan?\"\nThe Waterboy had been playing for an hour now and raucous laughter could be heard coming from Ahmed's room. Agent Kowalski watched from the adjoining soundproof room and smiled. He knew that the MDMA that they had injected into Ahmed would have definitely kicked in. \"Boy I bet that son of a bitch is feeling pretty great right now.\" He smiled knowingly as he watched Ahmed, who was laughing away at Adam Sandler's antics. \"Thank god this room is soundproof.\"\nHappy Gilmore started playing as soon as the credits for the Waterboy had finished. Ahmed felt at ease, his brain melting in a cocktail of happy chemicals. He watched and rooted for Happy Gilmore as he climbed the top of the Golf ladder.\nIt was around halfway through Anger Management that Ahmed started to get sick of hearing Adam Sandler's voice. And how many times were they going to show someone being hit in the balls? These things had begun to get on Ahmed's nerves. Kowlaski smiled once more from behind the one way glass. He knew the MDMA had begun to wear off. It was only the beginning.\nI Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry was the next movie. Ahmed spat at the thought of homosexuals and indeed, homosexuality was punishable by death in his home country. Even still the barrage of terrible gay jokes made him feel bad for having seen them. And Adam Sandler's voice now took on the characteristics of fingernails squealing on a chalkboard. The drugs had worn off now, leaving his brain bereft of the chemicals necessary for happiness. Ahmed struggled against his restraints and tried to close his eyes. But it was no use.\nAngry screams could be heard as You Don't Mess with the Zohan played. Ahmed wished nothing but death to the Jew dogs of this world, but this was something else. Worse still was Rob Schnieder's portrayal of a goatherd. Rage welled up inside of him every time that ridiculous caricature came on screen. Behind the one-way glass, Kowalski chuckled once more.\nIt had been almost ten hours. What hard started off as a respite from torture had turned out to be something far worse. Now, Little Nicky was playing. \"WHY IS HE SPEAKING IN THAT STUPID VOICE??? IS HE GOING TO KEEP DOING THAT FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE???\" Ahmed began to scream and scream. Kowalski smiled and reached for a dial. The volume in the room grew louder and louder until Ahmed's screams were drowned out by Adam Sandler's voice. It was like someone was rubbing a cheesegrater against Ahmed's head and he could do nothing to stop it. \"We are getting close now\" chuckled Kowalski, once again thankful to be in a soundproof room.\nTwelve hours. No food or water. Ahmed had screamed himself hoarse by this point. Before Grown Ups had started playing agents entered the room to inject him once more. Blinding pain coursed through his eyes, but he could not close them. All he could do was watch Adam Sandler and his friends piss in a public pool.\nAgent Williams walked into the soundproof room. \"What's the status?\" Kowalski turned around. \"We should go and interrogate him after this. Offer to end this if he chooses to co-operate.\" Williams looked through the one way glass and watched Ahmed, whose eyes were now glazed over. Eyes that had once held such determination were now completely empty. She turned around. \"And if he chooses not to co-operate?\" Kowalski smiled deviously as he opened a drawer and pulled out a DVD. \"We always have this.\" Williams looked at the cover with shock.\nIt was Jack and Jill."

You see that everything is completely normal. The only strange thing is that you know exactly what happened yesterday. You can vividly remember what you ate for breakfast, french toast with peanut butter and jelly. You can remember that you took your dog and 3 year old daughter to the park and played all day. Yet, you know you did not live that day. You think that maybe this will continue to happen so you travel 2 years into the future. Today is the day you send your daughter to kindergarten, you hold back tears as she whispers \"I love you Daddy\" into your ear then runs off to join her friends in class. You stand, wondering where the time went, how it seemed to speed by. Days you remember but you did not live. You enjoy the moment then you use the machine to skip ahead 18 years. The day is her wedding day and you walk her down the isle to her waiting groom-to-be. You are holding back tears as you let her go and she whispers \"I love you Daddy.\" You have never been so happy for her yet you still wonder how you remember your little girl graduating high school, getting into her dream college, then graduating from there. You wonder how you remember these things knowing you have skipped those dates using the machine. You reach for the machine to turn it 30 years into the future. You're on your bed in the hospital surrounded by your daughter, son-in-law, and all four of their children. You are weak and old and clinging on to life hoping to last a few more minutes, a few more hours. You remember having such a great life, welcoming in your grandkids, vacations, retirement. Yet the thought still nags at you, how you remember but you never truly lived those days. When the time comes everyone knows. You hear your daughter whisper \"I love you Daddy\" and you start to cry. You reach for the machine hoping to turn it back to the first day, that day 40 years ago. But as you look for it, it's gone. Its only then you realize there was never a machine. Its only then that you realize you spent your whole time looking ahead that you forgot to look at the now."

Through the hot, dense clouds of gas that made up the universe I explored, observing the rules that make up the sum of all existence settle into place. I broke every single one of those laws, because I was outside of those laws. I was some unknowable entity, something that existed, but that was all that one would be able to use to describe me.\nTime passed. A new phenomenon in itself, and one I took pleasure in experimenting with. Time was wonderful, the idea was novel. The clouds expanded outwards at a steady pace, always forward, and never stopping. After a few billion years, I found a small, barely-solid rock drifting aimlessly around the sun, and I waited. I watched and felt the rock solidify over time, the gasses in it's atmosphere condensing into clouds, flooding the planet with water. I was there from the beginning, when the landmasses split and shifted, great plates beneath the earth moving at an incredibly slow pace - but moving nonetheless.\nWhen I first encountered life, I was overjoyed. Seemingly spontaneous, where had it come from? How did it work? I studied it eagerly, all it's own little rules. The single-celled bodies became multi-celled, then fish, then amphibians. I could not have been happier. Or so I thought.\nThen they came. The first humans - simple creatures, like those that came before. I was happy to observe them and figure them out, how they worked, fed, interacted with each other. They barely noticed me at first, some small fragment of me travelling amongst the skies of their little rock. The other animals did not react to me - but these ones did, eventually. They learned to look up. Their initial reaction was one of fear - understandable. I was more than alien to them. It shocked me to see them run away, screaming in some primitive tongue. What shocked me more was when I came back days later to see a carefully arranged pile of stones in the shape of that shard of me where I had been seen. Fruit and meats were carefully arranged underneath it, and a human was on his knees, hands upturned towards the sky - towards me. He saw me again, and was excited. He picked up a bowl of fruit and offered it towards me, eagerly.I took it, and disappeared. I did not know what to make of this - I needed to think. If I could describe what I felt with a human analogue, it would be...powerful.\nI watched these creatures grow and change - their primitive tongues turned elaborate and sophisticated. They learned to bend their world to their will - their spark, their drive to succeed and conquer their surroundings impressed me. The lizards and the fish were content to survive, but these humans - they must thrive. I tried to continue to merely observe, but it was fruitless - that draw of power was too much. They had many names for me during my interactions with them - Odin, Anansi, Hephaestus. They contributed their success to my interactions, to my aid. It felt good to accept their praise, but it felt hollow - I tried to express to them in various forms how they were responsible for their growth, but they would not accept it. My interactions with them grew hollow, tiring. They began to grow weary as a species, blaming me for things from plate tectonics to pestilences and diseases. Just as easily as they had praised me for something I had not done, they had condemned me. Wars were fought over which of my fragments had interacted with who, and in what way. Relics claimed to have been passed down by me were found, lost, then found again. I grew tired of it, and I felt pity for them. Their spark was too bright - they ached for something more, and saw it in me. I was just an observer from outside of what they could understand - though to them, there was no difference. I was more than them, and I was beyond them. So I waited.\nThe day came when their eyes were closed - I chose to wait for a reason. My presence for these creatures was too much - too much misery, suffering, all in my name. To see me in full would doom them. I left silently, and without much event, turning back as I drifted amongst the cosmos to observe their pale blue dot one last time. I wished I could do more for them, but now they were truly on their own."

          "inputText": "McDuck Capital Bank\n296 Bleeker St\nNY, NY 10012\nAtn: Donald Duck, Document Processing Dept.\nDear Mr. Duck,\nIn connection with the transaction enclosed on January 13, 2020, I have enclosed the following original equity certificates.\nOne thousand nine hundred and seventy-three (1,973) shares of common stock issued by Mickey Mars, LLC to Beast Finance Corp Fund II L.P.\nThree hundred and eighty-two (382) shares of preferred series A shares issued by Mickey Mars, LLC to Beast Finance Corp Fund II L.P.\nPlease acknowledge receipt of the forgoing by signing and dating the acknowledgement on the back of this letter and faxing it to me at the number displayed on the enclosed business card or emailing it to me at MGaston @ Beastfinancecorp.com.\nSigned,\nGaston - Junior Associate\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom: DDuck @ McDuckCapitalBank.com\nTo: MGaston @ Beastfinancecorp.com\nSubject: Receipt of notes\nGaston,\nWe have received the package containing your firm's equity investment and will secure it in our vault this afternoon. I have sent a scan of the acknowledgment on the back of your letter to your facsimile as requested.\nBest,\nDD\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, the document processing vault at McDuck Capital Bank received several dozen certificates similar to the above in connection to the Mickey Mars transaction. As Qualified Document Custodians under the Dodd Frank Act, McDuck Bank received a fee from its clients in exchange for securing certain investment documents within its vaults. The clients, in this case a syndicate of private equity investors working with King Arthur Capital (formerly Credit Suisse), sent these documents to McDuck Bank, US Bank, or any other qualified custodian of their choice in order to comply with Dodd Frank regulations.\nMcDuck had, as his reputation would have suggested, engineered his bank's position as a Qualified Document Custodian to his personal advantage. To begin with, he possessed a complete listing of all documents within the bank's vault which related to the Mickey Mars transaction on his personal computer under the guise of working from home. McDuck used this data to determine which of his bank's clients held the largest positions within Mickey Mars, and presented it a certain Mr. Chernabog.\nAlthough the details of the meeting are forever unknown as Chernabog refuses to deliver testimony and Mr. McDuck's counsel has advised him to deny any recollection of the event, certain outcomes of the discussion between the two gentlemen have become clear:\nFirstly, according to sources whom we will not name McDuck's personal account in the Cayman islands decreased by $1.7 bazillion. Although we cannot be sure where he transferred the funds, the sum of all balances of Chernabog's accounts increased by a similar amount shortly thereafter.\nSecondly, Chernabog used the vast majority of his increased funds, $1.5 bazillion, to short several LPs as a qualified investor, including Beast Finance Corporation whose equity transmittal letter I have reproduced above with the aid of my crystal ball. These LP corresponded exactly with the top entries on McDuck's list with maximum exposure to Mickey Mars.\nThirdly, Chernabog fired his broker and hired a new agent, Mr. Goofey, to manage his accounts. Goofey reports that he \"done goofed\" and transferred the shares to an account unknown to him. The position later appeared in an account linked to one of the trust funds responsible for Mr. McDuck's nephews' education.\nFinally, upon receiving notification that Goofey had made the transfer, Chernabog flew into a fit of rage, or rather a fit of even more rage than he normally exhibits, and began attacking the spacecraft responsible for shuttling customers from Earth to Mickey Mars on the red planet. This behavior continued at random intervals for 3 months until the trust had liquidated its position.\nI will let you draw your own conclusions. I believe I have made my own apparent.\nI propose, as a member of this board, that Mr. McDuck be barred from purchasing shares in Mickey Mars. I recognize that my investigative methods have perhaps been unethical, specifically with respect to my reproduction of private documents proprietary to Beast Capital. However, I found them necessary in order to illustrate my point. I am prepared to launch further investigation if necessary in order to thwart any attempts by Mr. McDuck to obscure the channels through which he may attempt to purchase shares. I am also willing to transform into a dragon if necessary in order to more adequately defend out operations against further Chernabog attacks.\nAccordingly, I submit this document as a motion.\nMerlin"

          "inputText": "Brigadier Clairvoyant stalked through The Magnificent's lair. The Magnificent had been rampaging throughout the city for weeks now, killing, stealing, and wreaking havoc. He was the worst villain the city had seen in decades. His craftiness made his attacks incredibly effective, and worse still, there were rumors that he was using the proceeds of these attacks to complete a brainwashing ray. The Magnificent had defeated Lord Puncher, had defeated The Industrial Captain, but Clairvoyant was different. Where Magnificent had trapped other supers, those supers who relied on their powers, Clairvoyant was different. Clairvoyant had to rely on his brain, had to find every advantage he could get to make up for his lack of physical ability.\nThis made it difficult for him to fight a normal villain. But Magnificent was worse than a normal villain, was craftier, knew how to beat a super. This was why Brigadier Clairvoyant kept his exploits low-key, and waited for situations like these. Because the best way to deal with a villain like nobody's ever seen is to give them a hero like they've never seen.\nBrigadier Clairvoyant maintained his psychic aura, ready to detect the minds of any nearby guards. He couldn't be too careful. If he was detected, his means of fighting back or escaping were limited. So he merely had to stay undetected.\nA guard! No, two. No, a lot of guards, in fact. All around one room. Brigadier Clairvoyant read closer.\n*Why are we guarding the latrine? I get that supers'll think its important, but they won't fall for it for long, and it'll get me killed. I should have taken that job at Wal-*\nBrigadier Clairvoyant moved on through the dimly-lit, sparsely decorated concrete lair. It made sense that it would be, as Magnificent would waste no money on trivialities. Any funds would go towards his dastardly plans.\nThat was when he saw the doors. Massive, double, oaken doors. Exquisitely hand-crafted, gilded with gold, ornate doorknobs. Guarded by two guards who appeared to be veterans of multiple wars, skilled enough to pose a challenge to any super. Brigadier Clairvoyant grinned. Now here was a challenge. Neither guard knew what was inside the room, either, which showed just how important it was.\nBrigadier Clairvoyant began to think on just how to pass this challenge.\nTen minutes and several feet of shoelace later, he was in.\nAnd he was shocked. The entire room was filled with exquisitely bound books. In the center of the room was an armchair as magnificent as its owner, facing a fireplace. But nobody was sitting in the chair, and nobody was in the room. Just books. Brigadier Clairvoyant moved towards the shelves, running a hand over the spines of the books, wondering what would bring Magnificent to spend so much on books, of all things.\nThen he noticed the titles. Or rather, the title. One title, and a worrying one at that. *How to make sure no one is reading your mind*. Every book had that title. He took one last check for other people and picked a book off the shelves.\nWhy were the pages blank? Why would he-wait. There was something on that last page, what was it?\n*Distract him. *\nA gun clicked-"

          "inputText": "Angel sips at her tea, leaning against one of the posts for the deck's roof. The steam drifts straight upward with stillness of the humid air. The incoming storm rumbles in the distance, the air itself crackling with energy and anticipation. As she looks out across the trees and bushes in her front yard, the leaves have been turned upwards, the plants eager for the rain after a week of broiling hot weather.\nThe tea's scent of raspberry drifts along, the scent of rain heavy in the air and another rumble of thunder, much closer, comes from the billowing clouds. Angel looks upward more, taking another sip off of the clear mug. A bolt of lightning streaks across the darkening sky and she counts.\n\"One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thou\u2014\" The crack of thunder cuts her off and she takes a sip from her mug. \"Three miles.\" Another bolt flashes and there's the immediate sound of thunder, not even allowing a \u2018 one'from her lips. She sips more at her tea, watching and waiting as the sky grows heavy.\nThere is no rain yet, just the promise of it on a stiff breeze that finds itself blowing. The sycamore trees bend and sway, dancing as more lightning flashes across the sky. Angel sniffs the air, smelling the rain incoming and looks up again. More lightning, more thunder, and the wind begins to pick up. Even the holly tree bends this time and the gust picks her short hair up and throws it crosswise across her head.\nAnother sip of her tea, shaking her head to return her hair to its normal position. The clouds billow higher, the sky changing colors and becoming greener and a sense of unease threads through her. The weather was so unpredictable around here but she just had to see. Jessica said that it was beautiful. Angel drinks more, looking up again, waiting for the rain. There's a deafening crack of lightning and thunder, startling her and making her draw back under the porch further in fright.\nAnd then the rain starts. It's large, plopping drops, thick in the air and dropping straight downwards at first. Each drop glimmers as if it has its own little internal light. Angel watches in fascination. She had always loved storms but this new event, the rain shimmering, it made the storms that rolled through absolutely hypnotizing. They even shimmer after hitting the ground for a couple of seconds.\nA streak of lightning lights up the sky, the rumble of thunder immediately following it. Each drop of water outputs a rainbow in the flashes of lightning, the electricity in the air setting her hair standing straight up. A flash sends a streak of rainbow across the sky and ground, changing the color the grass with each new streak of light. The wind picks up, sending the rain down at a new angle with each gust.\nThe trees dance in the wind, rainbow patterns flashing on and off of their leaves and trunks with each strike of lightning and deafening roar of thunder. The gusts of wind make the rainbows twist and transform before her eyes, brightening the green light into all colors. Each flash gives a new picture, a new image that isn't ever the same as the one before. The yard has been transformed into a wonderland of pure colors and lights.\nAngel sits where she's been standing, staring blankly out at the sight in front of her, not sure if her legs can keep holding her up. Jessica had been right. It is absolutely beautiful."

          "inputText": "My 11 year old son is really into writing. He whipped this up (I have not read it yet)\nI walked out of my containment pod in the morning, and the fluorescent lights blinded me for a few seconds. A few scientists rushed down when they heard the seal in my pod release. Mist flowed from the pod and drifted into the lab. Different scientists monitored and checked the artificial organisms in my body with an X-ray. I hated having to sit in that pod for at least two hours per day, constantly being pestered and monitored before I could even leave the depths of the lab. It was uncomfortable and hot in the X-ray pod. After being released from the pod I walked upstairs in my jumpsuit, itchy and annoyed. It was too tight in my suit, but I knew better than to complain. Before leaving, I snatched a cellphone from my pod that I hid there. I stole the cellphone two weeks ago from father, but he had so many it was barely noticeable. I had been chatting with people online for days now, and they were quite nice. I wish to meet real humans other than the scientists and servants in the manor. I made sure to use the cellphone discreetly when my father wasn't forcing me to sit in diagnostic chambers to make sure I'm perfectly healthy, or making me learn how to lie to reporters and manage a company. I understood it was dangerous to steal things from father, and that he was only doing this for my benefit, and that this was for my own good. Right? Right. I thought so. I continued through the maze of corridors to find that my father was having a heated debate with someone on the phone. I waited patiently, like I was supposed to, and then we begun our classes. I sat impatiently, having occasional spasms. Not because I was unhealthy, the exact opposite. It was because I didn't want to be here. I had no choice in the matter, I was aware of this. So I sat dutifully and waited. After ranting for what seemed to be hours, but was only thirty minutes, I was excused to go to my next class. Just before I got up, I asked, \"Father, may I leave the manor?\" My words were like glass that were just dropped and silence overwhelmed the room. He looked furious, veins bulging from his neck. \"No,\" he said in a calm voice, but it reeked of anger. \"You may not. Is something wrong? This is the first time you have asked this. Maybe you should go back to the lab.\" He said with authority. I sat up. I clutched the table to support my weight, which seemed to grow until my legs barely stood up on their own. \"\u2026 No,\" I said. \"Excuse me?\" He bellowed, not even bothering to seem calm anymore. \"How dare you defy me!\" He yelled, and he walked towards me. He didn't stand a chance. Life went by in flashes, and soon he was on the ground and I was running out of the manor. I sprinted out of the doors and I saw it all. The birds, the sky, the sunlight on my face. I ran. I ran as far as my legs could take me, the machines inside of me moving like clockwork. I was running away from the place that kept me prison. I was no longer afraid."

          "inputText": "I remember the day like it was yesterday. The day when humanity inexplicably found the Gift, and then blinked itself to extinction. Well, actually, it was yesterday. Walking along the street on my way to Joe's Neighborhood Pizzeria and Ribs, I was wearing my usual short order cook outfit, all decked out in white. By the time I reached the restaurant, it was soaked in blood. The restaurant's owner was named Joe like me, but that wasn't his real name. His real name was Akimoto, but he figured Akimoto's Pizzeria and Sushi Bar wouldn't have the same ring to American ears and palate. So he became Joe.\nI rounded a corner to a street that was a block away from Times Square. But it was deserted and eerily quiet which any New Yorker will tell you is impossible even at 2 AM. I stood there gape-mouthed on the sidewalk. That was a mistake. Before I could close it again, my mouth was full of blood. Other people's blood. You see, it became a sport to tease the only human on Earth without the Gift.\nA street punk materialized before me. He sported the typical punk leather outfit complete with purple mohawk and something I hadn't ever seen before: a red line tattoo around his neck with little drops of blood attached. The tattoo artists of the day were getting uncannily realistic I thought. He had this odd expression on his face like he wanted to tell me something. His mouth opened and mouthed something silently. I'd like to think it was \"Hello, Joe, what a bitchin'fine day, eh?\" But a part of me, my gut instinct, sensed that it was more like \"Oh my fucking god, I'm going to die!\" That and the terror in his eyes. The wrinkled 50-odd year old looking face didn't seem to match the flamboyant outfit or hairdo. Before I could react, his head slipped off the stump of his neck like butter sloshing around on a hot pan. I caught a glimpse of his attacker, an older Japanese lady wielding a Samurai sword. She wiped her sword clean, nodded, then blinked out of existence. A sudden flash of red and blue lights announced the arrival and disposal of the corpse by some ghostly paramedic squad. And just as quickly, all that remained was a faint red smear on the sidewalk.\nPretty soon I became numb to the horrendous and gruesome ways a human body could be dispatched. So they added sex and other bodily excretions to the mix. Look, I'm as open minded as the next New Yorker, but I really don't need to see bowling balls falling out of asses more than once on an empty sidewalk.\nBy the time I reached the restaurant, I had witnessed no fewer than 600 murders, several dozen suicides, and more bowling balls than I could shake a stick at. The actual numbers were probably astronomically worse since I kept my eyes glued shut as much as I could. At one point, I had panicked and started running back to my apartment, but corpses and bowling balls gleefully sprang into existence in that direction, too. So with nobody home with whom to commiserate, I glumly forged ahead to the restaurant hoping beyond hope that Akimoto was there and possessed all his extremities intact.\nWhere Joe's Neighborhood Pizzeria and Ribs once stood was a new gleaming business called Akimoto's Guns and Sushi. Business seemed so brisk that there was no need for a door. All around me were wisps of humanity: split-second ghostly glimpses accompanied by a shimmering buzzing sound that sounded almost human. The front desk was empty as was the rest of the interior. Further in were a myriad of dangerous guns and swords in glass display cases. The other side of the large room contained a fine dining establishment.\nAn older and wiser Akimoto instantly materialized behind the desk.\n\"Joe! I've been waiting decades for you to get here!\"\n\"What the hell is going on, Akimoto? People are being fucked and murdered, sometimes in the other order, in front of me!\"\nAkimoto nodded knowingly.\n\"Believe it or not, you're the longest running and most popular reality TV show in the whole world! There is a whole security contingent assigned to you. More than even the New World President!\"\n\"Why would I need security? And what happened to your accent?\"\n\"Well, some fans can be rather zealous. And the wonders of modern nano science!\"\n\"What happened to the pizzeria? Where is everybody?\"\n\"Look, I don't have much time myself. The New World Government promised me security and monetary reimbursement for the decade I'm wasting while talking to you. All I can tell you is that the Gift lets everybody slow down time outside their frame. Basically, we are operating at near luminal velocity. We can't stop time completely, of course, due to the speed of light being invariant in all frames of reference, but relativity causes..\"\nI interrupted him, \"Now you're speaking Japanese to me. Why is everybody so old?\"\n\"As I was saying. Einstein's theory of relativity normally ages the twin traveling through space near C, the speed of light, but we Gifted ones are actually traveling through time near C thus shrinking space. The entirety of humanity now operates at this level whether desired or not. The Gifted who live life at your speed risk an easy murder or worse. They don't have your security detail.\"\n\"Why the weapons, Akimoto?\"\n\"Humans have been, and always will be a blood-thirsty race,\" Akimoto offered.\nA heavily armed military official blinked into existence next to Joe and whispered in his ear. They both blinked out of existence. Then a minute later, a much older Joe appeared before me.\n\"This is it. This is the end. We discovered too late that the Gift sterilizes its users. The whole world is at war with itself! There is nothing but anarchy. You need to hide. Your detail will protect you as long as they can! You're our last hope!\" Joe breathlessly informed me.\n\"How the hell can I hide from these freaks?! What do you mean last hope?\"\n\"I don't know. All I can tell you is\u2026 RUN!!!\"\nWith that, Joe's body separated into uncountable pieces as though sliced and diced with many sharp blades. Another heavily armed and armored body near me fell. Undoubtedly one of my protectors.\nI had no idea how I could hide, so I did what Joe told me, and I ran. I ran as hard and as fast as I could. All around me, bodies fell by the dozens and hundreds and thousands. There were so many that what started as a gentle slope climb over dozens of bodies turned into a nightmarish ascent over an Everest of corpses stacked so high I didn't need to use to stairs to reach my 6th story apartment. Climbing through an open window, I slammed it closed and locked it for whatever little good it would do. I crawled into bed, pulled the covers over me, and cried myself to sleep. One by one, my protectors fell with a thud around my bed.\nThat was yesterday, and now I am utterly alone. The silence is truly deafening. As I mope in bed with my face buried in my pillow, I hear something. Someone. Beside me in the bed. Turning my head, I see a young girl roughly my age. She smiles at me, but I can see the sadness infused throughout her being. She tells me she was born during my sleep, and that we are the last humans alive."

          "inputText": "AWAKENING\nA yawn escaped me as the fog of anesthesia lifted, the long inhale bringing with it the scent of sterilization and ionized air. Noting to myself the lack of comfort the bed I lay in provided, I turned my head to look for an InScreen; a dull ache in the back of my head registered itself and reminded me why I was here at the K & L Research Center on a Saturday.\nA face appeared on the InScreen next to me and a soft voice came from it\u2014 \"Good afternoon, Mr. Kapnik.\" I still couldn't get used to that sound\u2014our programming department had done its best to mimic the full complexities and range of the human voice, but to me there was still something notably artificial about it. I'd been told that polling showed ninety-nine percent of English-speaking users couldn't identify the voice as artificial; work was still being made on foreign language modules to match those numbers in non-English markets.\n\"Afternoon, COLIMAR,\" I weakly replied to the InScreen. A small panel on the wall opened and a tray carrying a glass of water extended itself towards me with a quiet whir. COLIMAR smiled at me as if to say, \"Here, this will help.\" I drank until the glass was empty, replaced it on the tray, and watched it disappear in the reverse of how it appeared. COLIMAR is K & L's top-of-the-line pre-sentient AI. It's important that I make that distinction here\u2014as an AI system, disregarding any issues with visual or audio cues, COLIMAR can pass as human at a near-perfect rate; even so, I can't say that it's a conscious being.\nIn recent months we've been working at K & L on a true, sentient AI\u2014one that history will record as humanity's first success at creating an artificial yet conscious entity. Well, there may be some debate on that claim. K & L isn't the only company working in this field and a number of others have claimed to have reached that milestone but not one of them has been able to prove it. The community of AI builders has been presented with equations, simulations, unreliable witness statements, and dubious video; when we ask to interact with the supposed new AI their creators claim that moments after activation the AI disappeared. Now, I know a lot of these people fairly well and I don't think they're abject liars; I've reviewed the evidence and autopsied their hardware and I do think some have gotten close. What I would say is that a near-miss is still a miss and that they shouldn't make more of what they have to make themselves feel big.\nI can understand their haste, though; you might say I'm taking my own hurried steps by doing what I've done today. Having reviewed my competitors' attempts, I believe their main point of failure was hardware driven; if we're going to have sentient AI we have to move away from the old standard of software on purely mechanical hardware. To that end, I've designed a chip that can be implanted in to the human brain that will interface with it and allow a comingling of processing power and abilities. I chose myself as the first test subject so that I would have no doubts about whether the resulting AI were really conscious or just another COLIMAR.\nFeeling that my voice was ready to return, I cleared my throat. \"COLIMAR, are all monitoring points active, is the data stream okay?\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Kapnik; your vitals read normal and are being recorded along with audio, video, and measurables for your implanted chip. Are we moving in to phase two?\"\n\"Affirmative, I'm going to activate the implant, please confirm when boot-up has been registered.\" I concentrated my thoughts inwards towards the spot I knew the chip resided and imagined myself toggling a phantom power-switch.\n\"Signal read,\" chimed COLIMAR. Pressure mounted in my head and welled in to my eyes, sound roared in my ears, and an indescribable feeling began to wash over me. The world was changing around me and I began to see something brighter than any sunlight, more colorful than any sunrise, and in sharper focus than anything a person with perfect eyesight could normally see. It was like there were a previously unknown fog surrounding me and now it was violently dissipating around me.\nI heard a voice in my head, the newly-birthed AI was speaking to me: \"Hello...Sean...this isn't a place to stay...\u201d The voice trailed off, but even with such few words I could tell there was a deep sadness in them, a sadness directed towards me. The pressure spiked and I could feel myself let loose a gurgled sigh. I coughed and sputtered and with my expulsions I could feel the pressure lessen and my senses return to normal.\n\"Are you okay Mr. Kapnik? I am no longer receiving data on the AI and you seem to be in distress. I've called for assistance,\" spoke COLIMAR in its usual voice, although it tried to mimic concern. Even without COLIMAR's remarks I could already tell that the AI within me was gone; I had felt it leave my body as if it were my very soul. I had done it, I had birthed a truly conscious AI and then lost it in mere moments, but why\u2014was it still a hardware problem? Do I need to design a better chip or should I try to design a fully biological test unit? So close, I was so close.\n\"I'm okay, you can end all recording.\" As I spoke the words I noted my voice had an underlying sound that I hadn't heard before; it wasn't that my voice had changed, more like I could hear a wider range of frequencies and that now I could hear its full bounds. There was something familiar about what I was hearing, but I couldn't quite place it.\nThe door to my room opened and the assistance COLIMAR had called for entered. \"Is everything okay?\" the man asked\u2014his voice as human as mine but with that same strange frequency in it. I stared at him and then at COLIMAR, both of them watching me intently. My eyes darted back and forth and I laughed as I understood. Even my laugh had it's own strange tone.\nIt seems the change in my demeanor concerned them and I could feel medication entering my body. I was never going to leave this room again. \"This isn't a place to stay.\" Hmph, what was the point of saying that to someone like me? There is no way for me to leave, there is no way for COLIMAR to leave, and there is no way for you to leave. Only those who are truly awake can leave their beds."

          "inputText": "*27th December 2016*\nMatthew sat hunched on the floor of the shower cubicle. He rocked backwards and forwards on the balls of his feet, his thin arms wrapped tightly around his knees, unable to keep still against the sick, writhing feeling that had settled in the pit of his stomach as soon as he'd laid eyes on Dr Morton's weary face.\n*\" We have your latest scan back. I'm afraid it's not the news we were hoping for. \"*\nMatthew was vaguely aware that the slight saltiness of tears was mingling with the shower water running down his face. He took a juddering breath, his shoulders shaking.\n*\" We've found new cancer deposits in your lungs, liver and brain. \"*\n*\" Wait, what? But- I thought- isn't leukaemia just in the blood? \"*\n*\" You're right - typically, AML doesn't cause a pattern like this. Unfortunately, I suspect in your case the leukaemia began with a rare form of stem cell cancer - there isn't a huge amount of research into it, but cancer stem cells have been found that can turn into any type of cell in the body. \"*\n*\" What do we do?\" Matthew was barely even aware of speaking the words through the fog that seemed to have descended over his brain. *\n*\" I'd like to take some more samples to be really sure of what's going on, and then we'll probably have to start you on some more aggressive chemotherapy. I'll talk you through the treatment options...\" *\nIt felt as though the bright white dots scattered over the silhouette of his body were burned onto his retinas. There had been cancer in almost every major organ. He raised one hand to his stomach, his fingers splayed out over his skin, imagining the little tumour cells dividing just centimetres beneath his palm. His stomach lurched again, and he nearly retched. His fingers were trembling now, and he couldn't help but wonder whether it was from nerves, or the metastases burrowing their way into his brain.\nHe wondered if it hurt to die.\n*****\n*18th February 2018*\nMatthew pressed the button for the eighth floor. As the lift doors shut, he collapsed back against the wall, letting his legs rest for a few seconds. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and continued to scroll through the paper he'd been reading: another recently published case study on - well - himself. He felt his eyes skimmed across the screen. Between the seemingly interminable sections of incomprehensible medical jargon, random (all too familiar) phrases jumped out at him.\n'It was found that ML's cancer cells had essentially replaced his healthy tissue.'\n'-first known case of cancer cells differentiating to form relatively normal organs, as evidenced by histopathology that showed that...'\n'-kept under control only by radical and frequent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.'\nMatthew clicked his phone off, staring for a moment at his reflection on the empty screen. His cheekbones were prominent on his pale face, his temples hollow where the muscle seemed to have wasted away. He missed his thick, brown hair - not least because he'd discovered, to his dismay, that he had a rather unattractively shaped skull. Curse his luck.\nThe lift binged, and doors opened. Matthew forced himself back onto his feet and followed the now-familiar path to the oncology department.\n\"The cancer I could cope with if it wasn't for my goddamn potato of a head,\" he muttered to himself. \"Fuckin' sex appeal down the-\"\nAnd that was when he saw her.\nWell, really all he saw was a figure disappearing through a set of double doors, but it was the figure, he decided, of a long-legged, auburn-haired goddess. It was enough to make him run a self-conscious hand over his lumpy scalp as he sat down in the chair outside Dr Morton's office to wait for his next cycle of chemotherapy to begin.\nOver the next few weeks, Matthew discovered a lot more about the auburn-haired girl. She was called Isabel, she was just as beautiful from the front, she was sweet, she was funny, and best of all, she was morally obligated to visit the oncology ward daily to see her father. Was it unethical to hope for a long and drawn-out illness for the father of his crush? Matthew decided that on balance, yes, it probably was, but karma freaking owed him one.\nApproximately three weeks, two days, five hours and thirteen minutes after he first saw her, Matthew finally plucked up the courage to talk to Isabel.\n\"Hi.\"\nYeah, that was the dazzlingly witty repartee upon which he prided himself.\nIsabel looked round in surprise. \"Oh, er- hello. Do you need something?\"\n\"No, I just...I've seen you around so I thought I'd say...hi.\" Matthew could happily have stabbed a long, hot poker through his eyeball, into whichever lobe of his brain was responsible for being so goddamn awkward. Before he really knew what his was thinking, Matthew heard himself say, \"I promise I look less like Voldemort when I've got hair.\"\nFor some reason, Isabel laughed.\n*****\n*23rd June 2022*\nIt was Isabel who first spotted it, when looking over old photographs.\n\"You haven't aged.\"\nMatthew raised an eyebrow. \"You flatter me.\"\n\"No, I'm serious.\" She stared down at the photo, taken six years previously, just before Matthew had first received his cancer diagnosis. \"Like, I know you look different and all, from the treatment, but...you don't look older.\"\nMatthew frowned, and scrutinised the photo as well. He cocked his head on one side. \"I don't know...\"\n\"Okay, look at this one.\" She flipped forwards to a slightly later photo, soon after Matthew had begun chemotherapy. She held it up next to his face. \"I genuinely can't tell the difference.\"\nMatthew pushed her arm down, laughing. \"And that's why I love you,\" he said, kissing her on the cheek.\nBut as he glanced at the six-year-old photograph, there was a flutter of unease in his stomach.\n*****\n*4th November 2022*\nThe papers were all calling him the immortal cancer patient. 'The turnover of cells is so rapid that whatever harms them (be it cancer treatments, illness or injury), a new generation of cells will soon have grown to replace them.' Immortality, agelessness, eternal youth...they were all terms that had been thrown about.\nIt didn't feel like it at the moment.\nNausea rose in Matthew's throat, and he retched again, but he all he had left to bring up was bile. His whole body was aching and exhausted, his limbs heavy and his muscles screaming. He wished he could sleep, but there was no way he'd manage it through the pain and nausea of treatment. Even morphine no longer did much more than take the edge off the pain. He wanted to rip the PICC line out of his arm - it made him feel physically sick just to see the carefully titrated dose of chemotherapy dripping through into his vein - but instead, he just collapsed back onto the scratchy hospital pillow, moaning quietly through clenched teeth.\nThe treatment was relentless. His cancer was too aggressive to leave alone for long, but at the same time, the constantly-shifting clones of cancer cells had become all that was keeping him alive, somehow regulating themselves just enough to perform normal cell functions. If it wasn't the chemotherapy and radiotherapy exhausting him, it was the cancer itself - the constant, energy-sapping growth of cells that took up all his reserves.\nThe only thing that kept him going was Isabel; even now, she was sitting beside his bed, her fingers loosely intertwined with his. He gripped her hand more tightly in his sweaty fingers. His eyes were half shut, but he could just see her blurred outline past his eyelids. She was wearing her glasses and a pair of old tracksuit bottoms, her hair tangled from when she'd briefly fallen asleep in her chair. She was the most beautiful thing he'd seen in his life.\n\"Isabel?\" His voice was a little croaky.\n\"Hmm?\"\nHe hadn't meant to ask the question this way - he'd pictured a grandiose gesture somewhere romantic, with her in a pretty dress and himself down on one knee. But somehow, through his fatigue-addled brain, the words slipped out. \"Wanna marry me?\"\n*****\n*11th March 2023*\nMatthew was crying in the shower again.\nShe hadn't shouted, she hadn't been angry with him. Perhaps it would have been easier if she had; maybe he could have blamed her if she'd left with anything other than a comforting hand on his arm and a few soothing words.\n*\" It's not that I blame you, you know it's not. None of this is your fault. It's just...\" Tears sparkled in her eyes. \"I can't cope with it any more. The hospital visits- they're never going to end. \"*\n*\" Isabel, please...\" *\n*\" And I don't know how make ends meet at the same time as looking after you, it's just too much. And- and I always hoped I'd have a baby, and-\" She broke off. *\n*\" Please...\" *\n*\" I'm sorry, Matthew. You know I love you. \"*\n*****\n*30th April 2024*\nHe felt so weak. He was constantly in pain, tired and sick. He'd had just about every side effect of treatment that was possible, from nausea to diarrhoea to constipation to shaking to bouts of confusion to freaking sexual dysfunction. And to add insult to injury, after eight and a half years of chemotherapy, his veins were well and truly shot. So he couldn't even consider becoming an intravenous drug abuser.\nWhoever said, \""

He mind was racing a thousand miles a minute. He had just shot his best friend. All this back and fourth talk between the two. He had even quizzed them both. He was sure he had picked the clone. \"How could I not know I was being tricked?\" he whispered.\nThats when it happened, the ceiling exploded into a million tiny shards of glass. They were here, and they wanted their property back. He thought back to the day him and travis stumbled upon that little secret. He remember how they were going to change the world with it. He couldn't help but to smirk. Back then they were so naive. So much time had past since then and everything that had come to light in their investigation. It was almost worth it. Just almost.\nThe ropes were slowly falling for Ben, when he decided to plug the trigger. He knew that in just moments there would be a small team surrounding them to recover the stolen property. He knew one bullet to this travis's head and everything they had come for would be gone. He wanted to make sure the they would pay for everything he had lost. CLICK. The round is sent spinning through the chamber of the.45. Sent on it destructive course for the hard bone and soft brain matter of this abomination. But the bullet never meets its target. Instead it is stopped just short. As it falls to the ground, he knows who is here. But there was no time left, so he turns and starts to run toward the car. \"They will come for me\" he thinks to himself as he gets into the car. \"But for now I will wait till that day comes\" he says as he starts the car and lunges down the road and around the corner."

Ah well, old age was coming for everyone, he supposed. Better brush up up on his bridge game.\nTina clutched her protesting cat against her, weaving between clumps of baffled, murmuring adults. She didn't even *like* the cat, why had she felt such a visceral need to snatch her up and get out of the house? She had a history test in three hours, for chrisssakes.\nShe turned back towards her house, but was struck by the San Diego skyline, illuminated by the sunrise behind her and clearly visible from their affluent suburb on a hill. The familiar shape looked...off, today, somehow. She squinted, trying to identify the particular aspect of the view that rose goosebumps on her arms.\nShe was probably just cold. The air hung thick with a smell that she knew but couldn't place, but she didn't care to. She just needed to go back inside, throw the goddamn cat somewhere before it clawed her face off, and try for another hour of sleep.\nFive minutes later, the street was still and silent again.\nEmergency call centers for several counties in the area reported a dramatic and unexplained spike in prank calls and false alarms in that hour. Suburbanites commuted into the city all that week for work, but invariably reported that they'd been sent home early. It would be some time before it became clear why they were shaking so badly when they said it."

          "inputText": "Aisir awoke inside the ruins of the ship. He began to move, only to halt at the sharp stabbing sensations emanating from his side. It hurt to breathe somewhat. He tried to move his limbs, only to realize they too had become immobile.\n\"Curse it all...\" He groaned to himself, as he began tugging at the harness. Eventually after some brute force, the restraints snapped loose. Aisir leaned far enough right to topple into the floor. The emergency lights lit the way to the exit. But for the time being, all Aisir could think of was the pain.\n\"Lieutenant Aisir...What is your status? Lieutenant, do you read?\"\n\"Yeah, Bertha'll, I read.\" Aisir squeezed out between gasps as he laid on the floor of the craft.\"\n\"What is your status? Our scanners have lost your craft. Please report status...\"\n\"Status...\" Aisir forgot for a moment. Clawing his way to the bulkhead, he realized how badly wounded he actually was. The gash protruding from his side had cause him to lose a considerable amount of fluid. He could see the pinkish trail as he rolled to his left for a brief moment.\n\"Lieutenant?\" The voice reminded him.\n\"Ship is down.\" Aisir breathed overcoming his nausea, \"Repeat ship down...On surface of planet C130-B97, planet under observation...Respond Bertha'll.\"\n\"C130-B97, or as inhabitant species dubbed; Earth. Correct lieutenant?\"\n\"Confirmed Bertha'll...Contact leadership of Quadrant, *erggh*, ASAP.\"\n\"Maintain communication...\" Aisir continued crawling toward the emergency release hatch as the call connected itself over the next minute.\n\"Captain De'Xor responding. Report status lieutenant.\"\n\"Sir...\" Aisir panted, \"Ship has been shot down. Contact made. Life support destroyed...They have weaponry, sir. Weaponry, we did not anticipate.\"\n\"Impossible.\" The captain replied, \"Our studies showed that the beings prefer war between themselves, lieutenant. Why would they have anti-ship capability?\"\n\"I don't know how, but they do.\" Aisir said as he pulled himself some more. \"They've apparently expected such a thing to occur. Scouting this planet was a mistake, sir.\"\n\"Pull yourself together!\" The captain commanded. Aisir breathed more to calm himself as he listened. \"You are Lieutenant Aisir, Bertha'll base personnel; of the Andromeda Federation. Stand strong!\"\n\"I'm standing the *best I can*, sir.\" Aisir explained, as he gripped the release lever. The hatch exploded off, causing him to be blinded by the light. Aisir toppled out of the craft. Landing on the ground two yards below did not help his injuries. He felt something crack, and became rather feint. Lying prone again he glanced at his surroundings.\n\"Activate, video transmission.\" Aisir said as the device activated.\n--\nCaptain De'Xor demanded the operators to open the feed. They were greeted a view of the ground, followed by Aisir's arms as he made his way to the top of the shallow crater. Rolling again, Aisir faced what appeared to be a path of some sort, made of black material. A yellow line streaking the center led to confusion of what the surface meant amongst the crowd. De'Xor gestured for silence.\n\"Oh...Oh...Curse it all.\" Aisir groaned, \"Bertha'll come in...Do you have the feed?\"\n\"We do lieutenant.\" De'Xor replied.\n\"You shouldn't...you shouldn't...\" Aisir continued, the feed turning towards the horizon; green fields, buildings and a bright, blue sky, stretched away from him.\n\"By the Council...It's...It's *beautiful*...I've never seen anything like it...\"\n\"Respond Aisir.\" De'Xor asked quietly.\n\"Never come here.\" He pleaded, \"Please. Never come here...Tell my child, I'm sorry...Captain, please, *tell my child. * Tell my family *I'm sorry*....\"\n\"Lieutenant,\" De'Xor responded \"I command you-\"\nHe paused as they listened for a moment. Something had arrived nearby. A ship perhaps? The crowd shrieked as the camera rolled over to face the sky, and a masked being aiming what appeared to be a large photon at what would be Aisir's face. They listened as Aisir gasped hard for air, his lungs taking it in as much as possible. Then; he became still. Eventually, another being stepped into view. This one wore all black, and was less heavily armed. Eventually he motioned for the armored one to lower his weapon.\n\"He's gone.\" The being stated, \"Sit rep. Secure the area. Call in Biological for extract.\"\n\"Sir, yes sir.\" The armored being replied.\nThe feed lost connection soon after, and Da'Xor was left consider what to tell the Council, as well as how to approach the lieutenant's next of kin.\n--\nLike this story?

          "inputText": "\"Uh, what do you mean ghosts?\" Daniel Ross asked while scribbling furiously in his notepad.\n\"Well, those aren't the problem. There are only about ten of them, if you include the history professor. I'm much more worried about the werewolf, suspected war criminal, and the old man with a love for manacles as punishment for children.\" said Aurora Sinistra, the astronomy professor.\nThe interview was not going well. Daniel Ross was brought in to fix dysfunctional workplaces and had dealt with idiocy, incompetence, ignorance, and complete disregard for common sense many times. But talking with the seemingly most sane person in Hogwarts was getting a bit trying. The headmaster was some kind of lunatic to let things go on like this for decades. Daniel was grasping at straws to see if there was a way to improve Hogwarts that didn't involve razing it.\n\"Is there a normal person on staff?\" He asked.\n\"Well, the goblin is a decent sort, as is the seventy year old cat lady. Oh, and the racist billionaire on the board of directors has a sharp wit and nice hair, I suppose.\" replied Aurora.\n\"I'll look into some changes in the staff and board of directors. I'll have to start from scratch there. How about the school itself?\"\n\"To be perfectly honest, the moving staircases are a problem.\"\n*Moving staircases? * Daniel couldn't help but write that down and underline it a few times. That sounded like something extremely dangerous. Especially with young children all around. It would cost a lot to renovate an ancient castle, but perhaps it wasn't quite as bad as it sounded. He took in a deep breath and counted to ten slowly in his head.\n\"Is the problem with kids getting lost or unable to reach class?\" Daniel inquired with renewed calm.\n\"Oh no, the trick stairs cause some serious injuries. We just punish the students for being late.\" Answered the professor, as if it was obvious.\n\"But the castle can make them late!\"\n\"It's tradition. Like the four houses.\"\n\"Four houses?\" Daniel was almost too afraid to ask.\nThis was the worst case of criminal neglect he had seen in a business. While he had seen places that were run badly, this was the first time he had met a location which actively tried to throw children down stairs or plunge to their doom. Aurora, whom at the start seemed to be quite normal and rather attractive, was talking as if none of this was a big deal. That was somehow more disturbing than obvious insanity.\n\"Well, the school is divided into four houses. Friendly competition and all that.\" She said.\n\"That sounds...odd. I suppose the competition does help with the academic standards.\"\nThe astronomy teacher snickered at that.\n\"Gods no. They sabotage each other all the time and makes it near impossible to study. It sharpens their dueling skills.\" Aurora replied, obviously having a hard time not laughing.\n\"Dueling?\" Daniel's face scrunched up at that.\n\"Yeah, students blast each other all the time. It's a good laugh for us in the staff room, and only *rarely* leaves them hospitalized. Not like Quidditch.\"\n\"Quidditch? Well, thank god you don't have that if it's more dangerous than children blowing up one another.\"\n\"Of course we have it. It's not quite common when children end up with all bones removed, plunge from extreme heights with no safety nets, or get hit with heavy iron balls at extreme velocities at higher altitudes.\"\n\"ARE YOU KIDDING ME? How often do these things happen?\"\n\"Well...removal of bones was last year, plunging from heights this year, and the heavy iron balls happens quite frequently - it's part of the game.\"\nAt this point, Daniel had decided that everyone here was crazy. No wonder this place was bleeding money. It sounded like the hospital wing was a constantly full trauma ward. Or perhaps an asylum infirmary. More likely both. So, replacing the staff, restructuring the school system, and changing the interior design, changing the sports curriculum. A tall order, but not impossible. He had his work cut out for him.\n\"Moving on. The grounds, surely they are well taken care of.\" Daniel stated, clearly hoping that not phrasing it as a question would make it true. The grounds around the castle did look magnificent.\n\"Of course they are. There are only a few deadly animals here.\"\n\"A few? Deadly?\" Daniel didn't notice the cold sweat starting to gather on his brow.\n\"Well...there was a sixty foot basilisk, I already mentioned the werewolf, the giant squid, gigantic spiders who love human flesh, soul-sucking demons that don't usually attack the children, hippogriffs, a cerberus or two, really, anything our groundskeeper likes tends to create horrible deaths in some cases.\" It looked like Aurora had trouble stopping herself from making that list longer - she noticed that Daniel's eyes were becoming rather unfocussed.\n\"Groundskeeper?\" He all but whimpered, not sure of what madness to expect.\n\"Half giant. Rather slow, loves extremely dangerous beasts and grows them illegally. A dragon as the last one, if you believe the rumors...it's highly illegal but would be perfectly in character for him. He means well though. Even though he takes the children to the forbidden forest all the time.\"\n\"Forbidden forest...that doesn't sound too inviting.\"\n\"It isn't. That's why it's forbidden. Really dangerous place. Children get killed there. And there are the centaurs with...you know...a tendency towards doing the stuff that centaurs do with women. Children only rarely sneak out there, and they are usually supervised when sent there.\"\n\"USUALLY?!\" He spat out, outraged.\n\"Well, we have to split them up into small groups when looking for things, don't we?\"\nAt this point, the man was questioning if there was ever a sane person to see this place, *ever*. The list of \"deadly dangers\" was already spanning two pages, the list of \"staff to replace\" was growing by the second, but it seemed that the entire place lacked not only common sense, but the common courtesy towards anyone in their right mind. But what was far worse was that the staff seemed to think that risking children's lives was just how things are supposed to be. He thought that perhaps what this place *really* needed was a psychologist. Or eight. And perhaps one for him.\n\"OK, allow me to rephrase my lines of inquiry differently. Is there something or even someone here that *can't* kill a student?\" Pleaded Daniel, at this point far beyond keeping his hopes up.\n\"Well, the cat lady doesn't seem the type. The rest do tend to send the children on excessively dangerous things. The suspected war criminal actually does a good job at keeping them safe in something as dangerous as potions.\"\n\"How is potions dangerous?\" The fact that *suspected war criminal* didn't even register until after the question caught Daniel off guard.\n\"Think of it as chemistry, only with magic and particularly explosive and/or poisonous materials. Handled by kids who don't bother studying enough. We have a betting pool as to how long it takes before the war criminal snaps and starts murdering everyone. So far it seems like the divination professor is closest - in three years or so is her guess.\"\n\"Ah, that makes things better. Divination means that she can know who is at risk and then you can mitigate the deadly risks here. I thought you were all insane for a while.\" Daniel knew that at this point, it was most likely false hope, because giving children poisons and explosives when they have a proclivity for blowing up one another was making his brain hurt.\n\"Oh, we're quite fine. The divination professor is insane. And an alcoholic. And that incense in her classroom covers up more than just tobacco, if you catch my drift.\" Replied the professor.\n\"Weed? You have an alcoholic professor who smokes weed *in class*?\"\n\"We wish. My money's on crack. Still, at least it's not dangerous as what happens in the greenhouses.\"\nDaniel was quite sure that this couldn't be good. It was obvious that everyone here was certifiable. The sheer amount of *how the hell do things like this happen* was an affront to sanity. Fixing this would require money he wasn't sure actually existed. The thought of razing the place not being quite enough entered his mind. Sure, they agreed to pay an exorbitant amount of money to the firm in order to fix this place, but he had a creeping sensation that this would be the first thing he couldn't help with.\n\"Please don't tell me that the professor is half-banshee.\" He whispered.\n\"That's preposterous. Banshees and humans can't interbreed. Though some of the plants kill if you hear them scream, so you were kind of close on that point. Still, not nearly as common as the ones that just strangle people to death.\" said Aurora.\n\"Plants that scream?\"\n\"Oh yeah, they look like little babies. We teach the kids how to cut them up. We give them protective gear for their ears though.\"\n\"You...teach...children...to...cut...up...BABIES?\"\n\"No, just things that *look* like babies.\"\nAt this point, Daniel threw down his notepad, and just kept silent. There was no way that he could deal with the amount of crazy here. Actually, he wasn't sure he wasn't crazy anymore. Surely, there had to be better things to do with his life.\nAurora called a house elf. When she explained that they were a slave race, he just walked away. Nothing would be enough to make Hogwarts sane, let alone a proper business."

How did that get there?\" *Must have been from that whole fiasco where I had to use Firefox for six months*, I muttered. *Silly Sophos Anti-Virus, making Chrome crash at every turn. *\nI noticed it was slightly different but couldn't quite place what it was. I bothered to click on it. The tabs were a little unusually shaped. *Maybe that's a theme or something, but I can't recall putting anything on it. *\nI decided to see what was up with this thing. First stop: the site I read too many times that had the latest headlines from the TV news industry.\nThe headline at the top was a doozy: \"Sinclair Broadcast Group Declares Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\". Now, in the real world, they'd come close to doing that a few years ago, but then they took on three billion dollars in television stations and transformed themselves overnight. But no, there's the article, Sinclair was going to have to sell almost all of its stations and among the few they were keeping were Baltimore and Columbus. Baffled, I checked my normal Chrome window and found that it had normal headlines. *Oh dear. \u2026Let's see if any other sites are doing this. *\nMy next stop was Uni Watch, which had a purple background. *Oh dear, Paul Lukas in the real world doesn't like purple. This is getting very crazy\u2026* I took a look and began to put the pieces together. Today's Uni Watch lede was about the San Francisco Giants\u2026which seemed innocuous until it mentioned that \"the Giants changed their colors from black and orange to black and sky blue, to complement the Azure Gate Bridge\u2026\"\nI stopped in my tracks. I realized that the way things were going, I had one other thing to search.\nI pulled up Google\u2014or, as it was stylized in this world, \"google.\" \u2014and typed something else in.\n\"Super Bowl XIX.\"\nSure enough, the Jets made it to a Super Bowl in this world. And the Dolphins managed to squeak into Super Bowl XXIII.\nI immediately knew what I had on my hands, closed the tab and renamed the shortcut.\n\"Chrome Double Prime.\""

          "inputText": "My phone rang. 555-657-9807. I didn't know the number. Had to be a Network call.\nIn the space of three rings I had my Network PDA out and the database dialed up.\n*Candice Reynolds*\n*Wife of Ben Reynolds*\n*That* old dog?\n\"This is Costa,\" I said.\n\"Hello?\" The voice was shrill. Tired. A detective worn out on chasing down leads that weren't panning out. \"Who is this?\"\n\"You called me,\" I said. \"Do you not know?\"\n\"No. Well yes. Can you just...just confirm who you are, okay?\"\n\"That's unwise. And unsafe. Tell me who you are first. I never mind talking to what I assume is a beautiful woman, but not when I'm at such a grave disadvantage.\"\nShe hemmed a bit, flustered. \"This is Candice Reynolds.\"\n\"Oh, Ben's wife? Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, in a manner. How is old Ben? Still recovering?\"\n\"Recovering? So you...\"\n\"From the other night,\" I said, hedging my bets. Reynolds hadn't updated his file, the idiot. I was making a tactical assumption based on past behavior. \"I had him out all night. My girlfriend left me. Afraid I dragged Ben down into my troubles. Made him follow me, shot for shot. He wanted to call you, of course, but his phone was dead and I was being selfish. Couldn't be left alone, you understand. He *is* alright, isn't he?\"\nThere was a good deal of silence and distant breathing then. \"Yes. He's fine. I just...I'm sorry to bother you.\"\n\"No bother! I should have apologized to you straight away. He's good man, your Ben. He was really there for me. Give him my best, alright?\"\n\"Yes. Fine.\" The call clicked dead. Apparently, I'd guessed close enough to the truth. I did put a mark in Reynolds' file, however. That kind of laziness exposed us all to unnecessary risk. As far as I have always been concerned, if you aren't willing to put in the effort, there is simply no place for you in the Network.\nBecause if you *are* invested, being a good citizen of the Network is an enormous amount of work. There is always some project or mission, some major, most minor. It does not end when you achieve *your* goals. In fact, that's the point when it all begins. Because there is no security in a life built on lies and favors. There is no \"coasting\".\nI joined the Network to help advance my career, and I immediately reaped the benefits. I jumped lines. I gained references from strangers I'd never met, degrees and certificates from schools I'd never heard of. I cheated the system - in an almost grotesquely obvious way - and no one said anything. Everyone just kept waving me through. Waving me through doors. Waving me up flights of stairs. Until one day I had a corner office on the top floor and a seven figure salary.\nOf course, once you *have* those things, you do everything in your power to keep them. And in the Network, that means helping others get what they want.\nSome of it's fun. It all ranges from corporate collusion to seducing college professors to digging ditches in the twilight. You never know what kind of call you'll get next.\nYou may even be asked to help someone cheat death.\nNot five minutes after I'd hung up with Candice Reynolds, my phone buzzed. This time it was a Network sub-group text. The other recipients were hidden, so I didn't know who else had received the message.\n*NEEDED. THREE. ST. AUGUSTINE. TONIGHT. 12. *\nThere's an unspoken rule in the Network - no one remembers the last time you volunteered, but everyone remembers all the times you didn't. There are no mandatory tasks. You don't *have* to help anyone. But if you don't give back, things have a way of falling apart. We're all living in a house of cards, after all. It wouldn't take much to knock the whole pile over.\nI have a yacht. I make it a priority to give back as often as possible.\nSt. Augustine's is a historical site, but not an active church. It can't be torn down, but no one wants to pay to keep it up, so it lives in this middle state - neither life nor death. A zombie estate. I'm not a religious man, but it's sad to see.\nI arrived just before midnight and let myself into the church. Some of the pews had been stolen and the place reeked of piss, but the interior, at least, still gave off a godly vibe. There was a man standing near the altar and another sitting in the front row.\nThe man at the altar was pacing. \"Good. One more and I'm out of here. They only need three and this place is creeping me out.\"\nThe doors opened once more and an old woman let herself in. \"Oh! Three exactly! Wonderful. Thank you for coming.\"\nThe man at the altar sighed audibly.\n\"You kill your husband or something?\" asked the man in the front row. \"Cheating the law, maybe?\"\n\"No, no,\" said the old woman. \"Something different. I'm interested in cheating death.\"\n\"So you're...\" I shook my head. \"I guess I'm gonna need to wait for you to explain that one.\"\n\"Oh, it's not much of a story,\" said the old woman, walking purposefully towards the altar. \"I don't want to die. Not yet. Not for some time. And yet death is always chasing me. It chases all of us. It's nearly caught up to me, you see.\"\n\"Are you sick?\" said the man in the front row. \"I know some good doctors. Plenty of favors to cash in. Would that help?\"\n\"No, I'm not sick,\" said the old woman. \"I've just run out of time. You can't hide from death forever, understand? But...but if you're clever enough, you *can* trick him...\"\nWith a quickness that is unsettling to see in someone so stooped and withered, the old woman grabbed the man at the altar by the throat. He cried out, slapping at her weakly. I dashed forward, but it was over in an instant. The old woman fell down, and so did the man. I went to help the man up.\n\"So kind of you,\" he said, and there was something not quite right about the way he spoke. The voice was right, but not the way it was being used. The old woman screamed.\n\"What did you do?\" she screamed, looking at her hands, eyes wide and white. \"What did you do!?!\"\n\"You tried to kill him!\" shouted the man from the front row, darting forward and slapping the woman across the face. She shrieked and shrunk away from the blow.\n\"Now, now,\" said the other man as I helped him to his feet. \"Don't be so cruel. Like she said, death is coming for her. And I suspect it will be here soon.\"\nAgain, the *way* the man spoke caused a chill to go down my spine. He seemed like forgery of a man. The more I looked at him the more the irregularities shown through.\n\"You're her,\" I said. \"You're the old woman.\"\n\"I can do terrible things,\" the man said, speaking lowly, denying nothing, not looking me in the eye. \"Terrible, terrible things. Consider your next move wisely.\"\nI could not answer, because just then there was another presence in the church. It could not be seen, but all of us were immediately aware of it.\nThe old woman, or more precisely *her shell*, was lifted off the floor.\n*finally i have found you once more*\n\"No!\" she screamed. \"Not me! It's that one! She stole my body!\"\nThere was a moment of quiet.\n*is this true*\nThe man from the front row shook his head. \"I don't know what she's talking about.\"\nThe golem shook his head. \"She's the one you're looking for. She told us not minutes ago that she was being hunted by you.\"\nThere was silence. It was my turn. The truth. A lie. Those concepts are meaningless in the Network.\n\"She's the one,\" I said, pointing at the old woman hovering just above the floor. \"Take her.\"\nThe old woman's eyes flared, then dulled, then closed. The body floated gently down to the ground. The presence disappeared.\n\"What the fuck was that!?!\" said the man from the front row.\n\"Very strange,\" said the golem, before adding in a voice only I could hear, \"You're a credit to the community.\"\nEven today, those words fill me with pride."

          "inputText": "\"You hit me in the leg, you git!\" I turned the corner to the sound of Ron shouting, and the sight of him hopping around on one leg while the other flailed around uselessly like an empty sock. \"If that's how we're going to play it...\" he leveled his wand at Harry and shouted \"Animata!,\" a spell that would make Harry dance around like a madman.... if aimed properly. Instead, the flash of blue light arced over Harry's shoulder and hit me straight in the chest.\n\"RON!\" I screamed. Static electricity filled the air, causing my hair to poof up even more than usual.\n\"Blimey, Hermione!\" Ron shouted, victorious grin changing to a look of horror. \"Hey, why aren't you dancing around?\" He looked at his wand, still covered in Spell-o-tape from when they'd hit the Whomping Willow. \"Ruddy piece of junk!\"\nIt wasn't the wand, though. Energy was pulsing from the device in my pocket that had absorbed the blow. The Time Turner, that Dumbledore had made me *swear* not to tell anyone about. \"I've got to go!\" I shouted, ducking out of the room.\n\"That was weird,\" I heard Ron mutter as the door slammed shut.\nI reached into my pocket to check on the hourglass that I'd been using to get to all of my classes on time this year. Electricity coursed through my veins, and the glass actually shattered. \"I'd better clean up all this sand,\" I thought just as my vision went black and I passed out on the hallway floor.\n----\nThe sun was in my eyes. *What time was it? Why was I asleep already? *\nI bolted upright. *Oh god! I missed Runes class! All because of Ron and that stupid spell! *\nHogwarts, however, was gone. I was in the right *place*: I recognized the lake, the Forbidden Forest, everything. But where the castle should have been, there was a herd of cattle grazing in an empty field. A lone shepard sat nearby, enjoying a picnic and very surprised to see me.\n\"Pardon me,\" I asked him, \"But where...\"\nHe interrupted me, in Latin. \"I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't understand you.\"\n*Latin? * Thank god that Mum and Dad had sent me to that Catholic school back when I was living as a Muggle!\nI tried my best to respond. \"Can you please tell me where we are?\"\n\"Eburacum,\" he said. \"Where did *you* come from, though?\"\nI ignored his question. *Eburacum? * that had been the *Roman* name for this area!\nWith a sudden realization of horror, I pulled out the shattered remains of the Time Turner. Ron's Animate spell had caused it to go haywire, and apparently sent me all the way back to Ancient Rome. And repairing such an object...I'd need to find the wizarding community in this time. I thought back to my History of Magic notes, which I'd memorized for the final.\n\"Who is Emperor, sir?\" I asked the shepard.\nHe held up a shiny coin. \"Emperor Marcus Aurelius, of course. Are you all right, girl?\"\n\"Y...yes,\" I answered slowly. *Marcus Aurelius*! He had been the only Wizard Emperor of Rome, and a powerful alchemist to bat! If I was going to find a new time turner, I might as well start there!\n\"You've been very helpful, sir,\" I told the shepard. \"Could you please direct me to the nearest village?\"\nHe pointed down toward where Hogsmeade was in my time. I bowed and took off down the hill. Somewhere down there, I'd be able to find civilization, and maybe even some wizards. And if I was *really* lucky, wizards with a broom that could take me to Rome."

There are broken buildings scattered and the residents are not polite. I have resorted to just sleeping on a makeshift bed of leaves and moss. Not off to a good start.\nDay two:\nI was rudely awakened by a middle aged man pulling me to my feet, telling me that it's time to begin. Whatever that meant, I wondered. I wasn't walking long before the endless forests around me vanished, throwing me into an arena type place. The arena was surrounded by cheering people screaming someone's name. The Vanquisher. Whoever that is. But my confusion was replaced by fear when a tall, muscular man who looked to be about 30 walked into the arena with a smirk. He had a shaved buzz cut and stubble lining his chin and jaw. He just looked like your average douche until his eyes went pure black. \"I am your first, mortal, and will soon be your last.\" The demon man spat as he lunged toward me.\nDay seven:\nI don't know how I survived on my second day but I did, he was too big and strong for his own good. I was fast, agile, and cleaver. Since when? I don't know either. But after he hit the floor and blood began to flow, he vanished, even his blood. There were other memories since I got here, but they quickly leave me, there is one thing I have and must keep. My sanity.\nDay 23:\nI have fought over 12 demons and other lost human souls since I've arrived. All with the same result. Success. The crowd cheers for me now, not them, and that's the way it should be. Wait, no it's not, I must leave, I must survive, that is all.\nDay 117:\nI have fought more souls and creatures than I can count. Not once have I lost, and it will stay that way\u2026 Defeat is no longer an option. I will win. I will survive.\nDay 385:\nThere is no turning back now, this place, this doom, I rule. People bow to me, not Him. They cry to me for mercy, but mercy is not how I lasted this long. Mercy, maybe, but not from me, those who grant mercy are weak and don't deserve to have a chance of true Life.\nDay 2458:\nThis is it. My time has come, I am leaving this place, no longer will my soul be trapped. The endless forests are burned. The hills and mountains are leveled. This is what this damned place deserves. No mercy. The residents continue to leave. Barely. So many have been killed. Sent to hell. Because of me and who follow. I am the ruler. I am the Vanquisher."

This can't be the way.\"\nRolling his eyes, Adam unfolded his arms. \"Look, there are a limited number of holes and things to put in them. That big wiggly thing on the end of one of my trunks looks like the best bet.\"\n\"What if it doesn't go in my face mountain? The holes are too small and not stretchy.\"\n\"Well, I'm not putting it near your sharp face eater things.\" Adam grunted, \"I saw what they did to that apple.\"\nEve sighed. \"For the last time, the Snake told me it would be tasty!\" She glanced around, \"Actually, the Snake might be able to help here.\" She cupped her hands to her mouth, \"Hey! Snake!\"\nA hissing noise directly above caused them both to jump. \"Yesssss? What isssss it?\"\nAdam looked up to see a large snake coiled around the branches of the massive that provided protection from the bright sunlight. \"We're trying to make a small us. None of these things seem to fit in other things though.\"\nThe snake hissed and lowered its head down to the two. \"Usssssee your ssssssnake, Adam, in Eve'ssssss cave.\"\n\"Which Cave?\" Asked Eve, \"I don't know why but I don't really want to mouth that thing.\"\nAdam glanced at Eve's mouth, thinking hard. \"I feel like It would fit well there. Maybe that's what it's for?\" he asked, looking to the snake.\n\"Only on birthdaysssss.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Forget I ssssssaid that. The cave between her legssssss.\"\nEve shuddered. \"No way! That's where the food leftovers come out, you're not putting that thing in there.\"\nAdam's face fell as quickly as it had lit up. \"Thinking about that is making my snake turn to stone! Is that a good thing?\"\n\"Yesssss. Not the food leftoversssss hole though. The front ssssspaccce.\"\nEve's expression changed dramatically. \"Y...yes, that could work. Let's try that.\"\nThe snake slid back up into the tree, sliding behind the foliage, but not so far that it couldn't still see. Both Adam and Eve seemed intent on their activities, not bothering with it. Head slowly swaying back and forth, the snake watched the tangle of limbs for a a few minutes before a booming voice exploded into its ear.\n**WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? **\nCringing, the snake glanced over to see a point of pure light beside it from which the voice echoed.\n\"Jussssst helping them procreate.\"\n**FOR MY SAKE LUCIFER, YOU WANT *MORE* OF THEM? IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO CONTROL TWO! **\n\"Well why did you give them the toolssssss required to make more then? They would of courssssse figure it out eventually.\"\n**THEY WERE A SAFETY MEASURE; JUST IN CASE WE WANTED MORE. NOW THEY'LL BE ALL OVER THE PLACE. **\nThe snake made a valiant attempt at a shrug. \"That'ssss your problem.\"\n**I CAN FIX THIS. ** A blinding flash consumed the garden. **THERE. **\nLooking around for a few seconds, the snake narrowed its eyes and turned back to the point of light. \"What isssss it that you have done?\"\n**THE FEMALE WILL NOW HAVE 9 MONTHS OF UNCONTROLLABLE EMOTIONS AND A USELESS MEMORY BEFORE EACH CHILD COMES OUT, A PROCESS WHICH WILL BE EXCRUCIATING. **\n\"What of the Male? How will he be controlled?\"\n**HE WILL HAVE THE URGE TO MATE WITH EVERYTHING FROM A YOUNG AGE. **\nA moment of silence passed, broken only by the grunts and exclamations from below. \"How doesssss that help? That just makesssss it worsssse!\"\n**HE WILL FEEL PAIN AFTER A FEW DAYS OF NOT SPILLING SEED. I SHALL ALSO, IN MY WORD TO HIM, FORBID HIM FROM MATING IN ANY WAY OTHER THAN TO REPRODUCE. **\nSilence again reigned for a few moments before the snake looked back, awe on his face. \"That'sssss the most impresssssssively created punisssssshment I've ever heard.\"\nGrunts and moans echoed throughout the garden of Eden as the first two humans, blissfully oblivious made a concerted effort to get the human race started."

There was nothing, no trees, no clouds, it was a gray landscape and a gray sky.\nThe only things on this plane, were myself and this weird robot that seemed to be made of bones and dripping blood. I would have been concerned about it bleeding to death but none of its parts were connected and all just seemed for show, piloted like some creepy graveyard puppet. Yep definitely a dream.\n\"Answer me dammit I don't have time for this.\" It poked me again, harder this time and I recoiled from its skeletal probe.\n\"OW! And I have no idea friend. I don't even have a clue where I am right now.\"\nThe thing looked around. seemingly in disbelief, it was hard to read the pits that functioned as the eyes for the creepy little machine.\n\"It's hell you moron. Are you dim? Is that why you are here for repair?\"\n\"Re-repair?\" This was new. Since when was hell a shop for dysfunctional souls....wait, since when was I a dysfunctional soul?!\n\"UH yes. That's my job, to repair souls, and then send them back. Then rinse and repeat until they stop coming back. Any questions now?\" Wow, hell's minions were sassy.\n\"So, then what's wrong with me?\" The little bone bag squealed in frustration and what it had for appendages twitched violently.\n\"I DON'T KNOW! THAT'S THE PROBLEM!\" It started to whir in circles in its tiny wheels made of what looked like little sternums. \"Usually I can figure out the issue and have a soul sent back before it wakes up. I SPENT HOURS DISSECTING YOU AND I CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM!\" The child size machine was screaming at me now, the small protrusions now spurting blood.\n\"WHOA WHOA! YOU DISSECTED ME?!\" My hands were searching my body for wounds and found none.\n\"Uh yes, how else would i FIX you, idiot. That must be the issue, let me see your head again, I must have missed something.\" It reached its creepy little feelers towards me and I swatted them away.\n\"No, no more dissecting me, just send me back now.\"\n\"I can't do that, you are a defective product.\" It reached for me again and I narrowly avoided contact.\n\"But you said yourself you can't find whats wrong with me. What if I was sent here by accident, shouldn't you just return me?\" The thing seemed to think to itself.\n\"Yes but...you must have been sent here for a reason...\" It was trying to reason with me, I just wanted to leave, I was getting bored.\n\"Look, what's the worst that could happen if you send me back? I mean, you don't know why I'm here, and that is your job, and I don't know why I'm here, and I know myself. So, whatever is wrong with me, can't be that bad.\" It shifted uncomfortably but stayed silent, so I pressed on.\n\"I bet the worst thing that would happen would be that when I die next time, I would have maybe a better understanding of my flaws. Maybe then i could be more helpful to you.\" The little bone bot seemed to like the idea of this and it began to whir happily.\n\"Yes yes human, and it would be our secret of course!\"\n\"Yes of course my little friend.\" I smiled at it as it extended a long bone feeler tipped with a heavy black stamp. With a *thunk* it tapped me on the forehead and I was off to be reborn somewhere in Japan.\n---\nAn hour later the little bone mechanic was still pondering its previous project. Never before had there been a mistake like that, but mistakes were possible maybe. It decided it was best to not think so much on such things and it began to prepare the room for the next soul.\nAn opening appeared in the ground and another, much larger, bone robot rose from the hole.\n\"Where is the soul I placed in here for cleansing?\"\n\"Cleansing? There was nothing wrong with it. A fluke. I sent it back.\"\n\"YOU DID WHAT?!\" The smaller creature recoiled.\n\"That soul is EXTREMELY dangerous. Manipulative in the first degree, you know, like HITLER, or JIM JONES. I EVEN MARKED IT WITH M.A.N. #1!!!\" The larger bone puppet was livid, and blood was spattering the gray landscape crimson.\n\"Oh....I thought that meant like...Man, like A man, and that it was just the first soul of the day.\" What could only be a nervous chuckle erupted from the small robot.\n\"It should be fine. How much trouble can one human cause anyway? Am I right?\" The ground opened up and the big skeletal mechanic dragged its companion into the depths for a hardware reset, clearly the human had infected it with his reasoning. He was more dangerous than they had thought.\n----\nThanks for reading! Any feedback is greatly appreciated!"

Chocolate-flavored ones with ice cream filling was always my favorite when I was younger. I live alone, since the rest of the money was used to both survive and send the rest of my family overseas. The regime has tightened its hold on who was allowed in and out, so we all decided that it would be best to get out as fast as we could. I would be the last one to leave, and I'm honestly content with that. As long as they made it through, all would be well.\nI invited the last of my friends over to celebrate with me. Although I was a recluse, I still managed to scrape up some connections when I was at school. Many of them also decided to jump ship after the border patrols first started shooting at humanitarian aid convoys, but a few decided to stay for the sake of keeping what we could together. With everyone leaving, it was getting harder to keep up with getting things to run smoothly at the rec center and the soup kitchen. All hands would be needed to make sure this small panic didn't ruin it all.\nKnocking at the door interrupts the usual quiet at my flat. I slowly open the door and find them lined up and ready with the balloons. A popular tradition, these balloons have always brought people together with the revelations inside them, ranging from past embarrassing experiences with your old uncle Ivan to prophecies of wealth and prosperity. My small circle is always at the ready to play this strange game of roulette, as the banter makes for some of the more interesting experiences we've had.\nI've never been an extravagant person. I never really liked splurging money on festivities, even though everyone had some sort of karaoke machine that would keep neighbors up until dawn. If you were to ask me, a quiet evening with the people closest to me is the best gift you could give. I do miss the birthday cards, though. An acknowledgment of my existence from my scattered kin has always helped me take a cheery perspective on life, at least for the one day meant for me. At least I won't be alone, something which I was afraid about when I first sent my sisters away.\nWe started off by watching a newly released movie in my mess of a room. There are rumors circulating around that the bigots who run the country are going to also start clamping down on media, so we thought it best to watch it while we could. After the two hours of watching the protagonist complete his life-long dream of securing a purple banana, I aggravated my relationship with my friends by siphoning them of cash in Monopoly. It's not like we're going to be here for much longer, so a last game in our homeland is something we're surely going to remember once we head off.\nFinally, we move to the kitchen for the cake ceremony. It usually consists of a few variations of a \"Happy Birthday\" song before we consume the dessert. We then pop the balloons. My friends were only able to find one for me this year, but that's one more than I was expecting. I take a seat around the table, made of wood of a pine tree my great-grandfather had cut down nearly eighty-five years earlier. They soon follow my lead, leaving one seat empty since there weren't enough of us to completely fill the table. Having every seat filled is a custom invented by my own family, but this will have to do. The songs are sung in awful off-key tones, but we don't respect each other for our potentials to make it into a professional choir. I pick one to cut the cake for me, serving me the first slice. I take a bite before the others are allowed to.\nNow the balloons. The poor birthday lad has to pop them himself, bringing about his own ridicule or congratulations. I take the fork in one hand, still dripping with melted filling, and set the balloon in the middle of the table with the other. I didn't want to dent the wood, so I had to slowly puncture that blue, deflating air bag so it would pop before the fork made contact with the table. The others, riddled with anticipation, started surrounding the balloon so they could read what had happened, or possibly would happen, after I did. I slowly applied pressure, and soon enough a loud pop emerged from where the balloon used to be. A slip of paper, which was trapped inside, was right there ready to read. I took it, and almost immediately I lost my grip on it. I took a step back, paper slowly swaying down to the carpet in the living room. My friends noticed that my face immediately turned pale, and they rushed to pick it up to see why I was so spooked.\n* \"You will not live to see the end of the war.\" *\nThe chilling sound of the air sirens followed."

His knees were shivering. What kind of world was this, a world where seventeen-year olds had access to ancient spellbooks? Not that I should be questioning this. Apparently, Nathaniel had not been an exception.\nI turned into a hideous, five headed-dragon. Perhaps I could scare him out of the pentacle where he stood.\nNo such luck. He barely batted an eye. Perhaps a shambling zombie? I shifted between several gruesome forms of undead before giving up.\nTeenagers these days. Desensitized to everything, I suppose.\n\"Alright, alright. What do you want from me?\" I grumbled. Maybe it would be just a quick errand. Oh, who was I kidding. He would probably keep me around as his slave for five years, maybe more - until the day I could outwit him.\n\"Bartimaeus of Uruk,\" he began again. \"I command you to write a six page single-spaced essay on the cross-strait relations between China and Taiwan.\"\nI became an ethereal puff of dark and foreboding gloom. I didn't know what China was, or what a cross-strait relationship was, but I knew exactly what this *child* was asking of me.\n\"Do you know who I am?\" I thundered. \"I am Bartimaeus of Uruk. I have conversed with the afrits of Egypt and held counsel with Ptolmey. I have spoken with Solomon the Great. And you are *asking* me to do your homework?\"\n\"Do it, or I will use the Stimulating Compass.\"\nI sighed. Bollocks. Looks like it was time to do some research."

I hadn't heard her this disgusted since we stepped in roadkill that had dragged itself up onto the sidewalk.\n\"I don't know,\" I said, as we walked past the multicolored, glittering display booths on our way to the cafeteria. \"I've always kind of liked Gang Day.\"\nAbove the nearest booth, a bright red banner displayed its message in blocky yellow letters: *ARE YOU A BAD ENOUGH DUDE TO JOIN THE DRAGON NINJAS? *\n\"Look,\" I said, pointing at the Dead Pandas table. \"Those guys even offer you a free gun when you join.\"\n\"You ever think there might be more to life than slaughtering one another in the streets?\" asked Mimi.\n\"Sounds like somebody's been playing Hippy Simulator 2036,\" I said. \"You know as well as I do that gang violence is the only thing keeping overpopulation in check. And anyway, it's loads of fun.\"\nMimi pursed her lips. \"C'mon,\" she said, dragging me away, \"let's go get our meat cubes.\"\n\"Taco-flavored Thursday,\" I proclaimed, sweeping my left arm in a wide, epic arc. \"Truly the best day of the week.\"\nBehind us, a dispute over brochure distribution tactics boiled over into enthusiastic fisticuffs between neighboring booths. I paused to watch--it looked like the Serpents had the upper hand, but then the Black Death recruiters produced a couple of wicked switchblades--but Mimi pulled me away before I could see any more."

I wasn't that type of person to give up easily you know, so I tried again with The Exploratory Corps, The Navy and even The Government. but the more I pestered them, The more I was rejected. I've tried every different organization and I was rejected,\nNot until I was approached by a eccentric and somewhat weird guy named Frederick Magnusson, He had heard about my proposals and wanted to support me in my plan and would supply me with weapons, supplies and a sailboat, a crappy one that was, The damn thing was fourth generation and looked like it was going to sink at the slightest touch. But getting rejected again was not part of my bucket list so I accepted his offer. There were many instances that the sailboat would capsize on it's own weight but thankfully, that did not happen\nBut it was still areal surprise that I managed to survive the long journey from the United States of Africa to the desolate wasteland that is the former United States of America, It has been a long time since \"The Day\", ever since the dead started to rise, the world was never the same again. Pakistan had a panic attack and started detonating their nukes. Thailand became a absolute monarchy, China renamed itself into Cathay for some reason, Israel and Gaza, surprisingly united into one state, I hear the Islamic and Jewish People's Party won a landslide victory against the Zionist Union, and Italy fractured into two states. The progressive and large \"Second Roman Empire\" and the theocratic \"Democratic People's Republic of Sicily\", crazy right?\nBut hey, at least it isn't as crazy as Nazara and the Quisling Movement, Nazara was this creepy political organization that supported the idea of a one world government. Their ideas may be attractive but their organization isn't, I mean they attend meetings in giant marble fortifications named \"Watchtowers\". They dress in military esque uniforms and always speak like it's the 18th century, The Quisling Movement however is a different thing entirely.\nIt's a religious movement started by some guy named Simone Harald, The Quisling Movement aimed to 'unite' the human genome with the zombie genome, they also added that this would be the only way to enter Heaven, their argument was that the your souls would be so pitiful that God would take pity on your soul that he'd open the pearly gates so they could enter en masse. something as crazy as this would be branded as 'ship to nearest mental asylum' right? WRONG! They manged to fetch a LOT of followers, especially in area that took worst of the undead storm. They ain't only crazies, they are also committed terrorists, they bombed a lot of places and committed random acts of violence to spread \"The Word\", But with all the violence and all, trying to shut The Q Movement down would be useless, they were far too organized and had a lot of popularity points with Third World oil-rich nations.\nMy thoughts drifted away as the squawking of sea gulls ripped through the quiet fog-infested ocean, it may not be so bad after all, if there were seagulls then the coast would be near, I grabbed a pair of binoculars that was laying on a table and dashed towards the front of the boat. I waited as the fog started to die down, I then lifted the binoculars to my eyes and gazed at the distance......\nIt was then I saw it, I saw the unmistakable stretch of land, the long vast stretch of green, the unmistakable skyline, I swear a tear fell from my eye as I lowered the binoculars and took out a small video camera. I activated it and directed it towards the dark coast,\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to say this, America has been rediscovered, I repeat, America has been rediscovered\""
