The 2013 movie *12 Years a Slave* showed us that slavery was a problem not just in America, but all around the world. The film made a lot of money, over $150 million outside the U.S. and $57 million in the U.S., with a budget of only $20 million. It’s based on the real-life memoir of Solomon Northup, who was a free African American man kidnapped and sold into slavery. The story follows Solomon’s life for twelve years as he’s traded between different slave owners, separated from his family. Thankfully, he meets someone who helps him send a message to his loved ones, and they come to save him. The movie really shows how unfair and harsh the relationship was between white slave owners and Black slaves, all rooted in a broken system and people's prejudiced thoughts at that time.

The movie mainly shows two groups: White people and African Americans. It also highlights different social classes—wealthy slaveholders, middle-class workers, and enslaved people. It begins with Solomon Northup, a free Black man and talented violinist living happily with his family in Saratoga, New York. But one day, he’s kidnapped by two white men, brutally tortured, and sold into slavery, where he’s given a new name, Plat. Before his kidnapping, Solomon and the slave traders were all part of the middle class, but because Solomon was Black, the traders believed they had the right to take away his freedom. His two owners in the movie are William Ford, who is kind and religious, and Edwin Epps, who is cruel and abusive. Since the story is based on real events, it shows how slaveholders had different personalities, but all shared the wrong idea that Black people were inferior.

Even though *12 Years a Slave* is about slavery, it also touches on themes like individuality and the importance of community. Solomon never truly accepted that he was a slave; he kept insisting he was a free man. Meanwhile, the others around him had grown up believing slavery was normal and helped each other because they saw themselves as part of the same group. Solomon’s goal was always to return to his family, even if the others thought differently and focused on their shared identity as slaves.

The movie also clearly shows how unfair stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination were against Black people. For example, when Solomon and a woman named Elisa are brought to a plantation, his owner’s wife feels sad that Elisa is away from her kids but then says that “food and rest” might help her forget her children. This shows how some white people believed that slaves didn’t have the same feelings as them. Another example is Tibeats, a carpenter who gets angry at Solomon just because Solomon gives good advice and shows he’s smart. Tibeats thinks that no Black person can be better than a white person because he calls Solomon a “nigger,” showing how racist ideas made him intolerant. Before Solomon was enslaved, he had never faced discrimination, but once he was sold into slavery, prejudice became all he saw from others.

In conclusion, *12 Years a Slave* tells the story of what life was like for enslaved people and their owners about two centuries ago. It follows Solomon from a happy life with his family in New York to his kidnapping, slavery, and finally, his freedom. The film raises important issues like discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes, and unfair generalizations that allowed slavery and the hurtful beliefs to last for so long. It reminds us of the dark parts of history and the importance of fighting against injustice.
