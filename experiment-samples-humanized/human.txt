The 2013 movie 12 Years a Slave shows us that slavery was a problem not just in America, but all over the world. The film made a lot of money, earning $150 million outside the U.S. and $57 million in the U.S., from a budget of only $20 million. It’s based on a true story from the memoir of Solomon Northup, a free black man who was kidnapped and forced into slavery. The movie tells how Solomon was taken from his family in New York, sold as a slave, and forced to live with cruel masters for twelve years. Luckily, he finally found someone who helped him send a message to his family, and they came to rescue him. The story really shows how racist ideas and unfair treatment between white slaveowners and Black slaves were part of a messed-up system in the past.

The film mainly shows two groups: White people and Black people. It also depicts three social groups: rich slaveholders, middle-class workers, and enslaved people. The story begins with Solomon Northup, a talented violinist who lives happily with his family. But then, two white men kidnap him. They beat him and sell him into slavery, changing his name to Plat. Before this, Solomon was just a regular middle-class man. But because he was Black, the kidnappers thought they had the right to take his freedom. Solomon’s owners were William Ford, who was kind and religious, and Edwin Epps, who was cruel and violent. Since the movie shows real events, it’s clear that not all slaveholders were the same, but they all believed false ideas about race that led to terrible treatment of slaves.

Even though the movie is about slavery, it also talks about the ideas of being part of a group versus being an individual. Solomon never really accepted that he was a slave; he kept thinking of himself as a free man. But the other people on the plantation had a collective attitude, meaning they believed slavery was normal and helped each other because they were all part of the same group. Solomon wanted to go home, which was more important to him than fitting into the community of other slaves.

The film also shows how people were prejudiced and unfair to Black people. For example, when Ford’s wife sees Solomon and Elisa at the plantation, she feels sad that Elisa was separated from her children. But then she says that “something to eat and some rest” might help Elisa forget her children. This shows the stereotype that slaves didn’t have real feelings like white people. There’s also a scene where a White carpenter named Tibeats gets angry at Solomon because Solomon shows he’s smart and gives good advice. Tibeats believes that a Black man could never be smarter than a white person just because he’s Black. Solomon hadn’t faced discrimination before, but once he was enslaved, it was all he saw — people judging him just because of his skin color.

In conclusion, 12 Years a Slave tells the story of what life was like for enslaved people and slave owners about 200 years ago. It follows Solomon from his happy life in New York to his kidnapping, years of slavery, and finally, his freedom. The movie helps us understand important issues like discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes, and unfair generalizations, which allowed slavery to keep going for so long. It’s a powerful reminder of how harmful these ideas are.
