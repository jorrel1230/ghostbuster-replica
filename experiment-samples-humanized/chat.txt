Body:  
1. Collectivism:  
The movie shows how slavery made people think of slaves as just part of a big group, not as individuals. They were seen as property and were not allowed to have their own identities. This idea of treating everyone the same way led to black people being seen as less than human, mainly because of racist beliefs.  
a. Abuse: The film shows how slaves were physically hurt and emotionally broken. These terrible acts were used to control them and make them feel powerless, stripping them of their dignity.  
b. Resistance: Even in such awful conditions, some scenes show slaves supporting each other and working together. Their unity gave them strength and showed that they could resist slavery as a group.

2. Individualism:  
The movie also talks about the importance of individual stories and how some people fought back in their own ways. Each character’s experience was different, and their individual actions showed resilience and hope.  
a. Solomon Northup: He was the main character and represents how strong a person can be. Despite everything, he tried hard to keep his identity and find freedom. His strength inspired others and showed that one person can make a difference.  
b. Patsey: She was another important character who faced terrible abuse, especially sexual exploitation. Her story shows both how slavery affected everyone and how each person’s specific suffering adds complexity to understanding the whole system.

3. Slavery as a Global Problem:  
The film shows that slavery wasn’t just a problem in one place, but a worldwide issue. It affected many countries and cultures, with similar systems of oppression.  
a. Hierarchy in Slavery: The film shows how white slaveowners were on top, and black slaves were at the bottom, a system that existed in many parts of the world.  
b. Prejudice and Stereotypes: The movie also shows how false ideas and stereotypes were used to justify slavery. These biases were deeply rooted in society and made it harder for people to see the humanity in others, which is why change is needed everywhere.

Conclusion:  
To sum up, "12 Years a Slave" uses themes of collectivism and individualism to show how slavery was a global problem. It highlights how black people were mistreated and dehumanized through unfair stereotypes and discrimination. The movie also shows that unity among slaves and individual acts of courage helped them resist and survive. Overall, it encourages us to recognize these issues and work toward ending racism and systemic oppression, so everyone can be treated equally.
