Introduction:  
The movie "12 Years a Slave" is a really powerful film that shows how horrible slavery was. It talks about how people saw slaves as just property and that everyone was affected by this terrible system. The movie also shows how prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination hurt black people in many ways, affecting their lives deeply.

Body:  
1. Collectivism:  
The film shows how slavery made it seem like all slaves were the same and treated as one big group rather than individuals. Slaves were whipped, forced to work, and their identities were taken away from them. They were seen as things, not people. This way of thinking helped keep slavery going because it made people believe that white people were better.  
a. Abuse: The movie shows how slaves were hurt physically and emotionally. They were beaten and treated badly just to control them. This made them feel powerless and robbed them of their dignity.  
b. Coming Together: Even with all the suffering, the movie also shows moments where slaves supported each other. Their unity helped them find strength and hope to resist their situation and stay connected as a community.  

2. Individualism:  
The film also shows that each person has their own story and struggles, even in a system that tries to erase their identity. Some characters stand out because they do things in their own way to fight back against slavery.  
a. Solomon Northup: He is the main character and his story shows how one person’s strength and desire for freedom can inspire others. Despite the terrible conditions, Solomon keeps his sense of who he is and fights to regain his freedom.  
b. Patsey: Patsey’s story shows both the suffering shared by many slaves and her own unique hardships. She faces unfair treatment, especially sexual violence, which reveals how slavery was not just about working, but also about cruel prejudice and abuse targeting individual people.  

3. Slavery Around the World:  
The movie also helps us understand that slavery was a global problem, not just something that happened in one place.  
a. Hierarchy: The film shows a clear social system where white slaveowners are at the top and black slaves are at the bottom. This kind of unfair hierarchy existed in many countries, making slavery a worldwide issue.  
b. Prejudice and Stereotypes: The film shows how harmful beliefs about race were used to keep slavery going. These stereotypes made it easier for people to justify treating others badly and showed how important it is to fight against unfair ideas everywhere.  

Conclusion:  
In the end, "12 Years a Slave" uses the ideas of collectivism and individualism to show how slavery was a huge global problem. The movie highlights how prejudice and stereotypes dehumanized black people, but also how unity and personal strength can help resist these terrible systems. It’s a reminder that we all need to recognize and fight against injustice. Watching this film makes us think about the importance of fairness and respect for everyone, no matter their background.
