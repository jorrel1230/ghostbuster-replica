The movie "12 Years a Slave" shows how terrible slavery was and also talks about ideas like individualism and collectivism. It helps us understand how slavery was a system where slaves weren’t seen as people, but as property. The film shows how slavery involved a lot of physical and emotional pain, but also shows that people could resist and stay strong when they worked together.

The movie also looks at how each character’s experience is different. For example, Patsey goes through a lot of suffering, but she also shows how people can be strong even in hard times. Solomon Northup, the main character, shows how someone can hold on to their own beliefs and strength, even when everyone else around them is suffering.

Overall, the movie makes us think about slavery not just as an American problem, but as something that happened all over the world. It also shows how the big plantation system was built on a strict hierarchy. The film really made me think about how people can be broken down by systems like slavery, but also how they can find ways to fight back and stay true to themselves.
