The movie "12 Years a Slave" shows us how big issues like individualism and collectivism play a role in slavery, and it really makes you think about how brutal and horrible slavery was. It shows how slaves weren’t seen as people with their own worth, but just as property that could be bought and sold. The film also highlights how slaves suffered both physically and emotionally, but also how some fought back and found strength in each other.

The movie does a good job of showing that each person had their own unique story and struggles. For example, Patsey’s story shows both the collective pain shared by many slaves and her own personal fight to survive. Solomon Northup, who is the main character, stands out because he tries to stay true to himself and refuse to let the system break his spirit, showing how even one person’s strength can make a difference.

Overall, the film makes us think about how slavery wasn’t just a problem in America, but a global issue. It also shows how the hierarchy on plantations kept the system going, with some people having all the power and others suffering under it. This film really made me understand the terrible cost of denying people their freedom and individuality.
