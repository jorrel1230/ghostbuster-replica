Rain is falling now, and it kinda looks like it’s shining or shimmering or whatever. This is actually the first really bad thunderstorm since all that weird stuff started happening about six months ago. Honestly, it’s pretty wild.

So, I just moved to this small town called Willowbrook a few weeks before all this rain and lightning stuff started. It’s super quiet here, surrounded by hills and rivers, and it felt peaceful, like nothing crazy was going on. But then, one day, everything changed.

I was sitting in my favorite spot at the local café, just drinking my coffee and looking out the window, when the sky suddenly went dark. The clouds looked like they were swirling in shades of purple and blue, and that’s when I knew something was about to go down.

Everyone in the café started staring out the windows and whispering. The rain began to fall, but it wasn’t like normal rain — it was glowing and colorful, like in a dream. The drops looked like little orbs that shimmered in every color you can think of. Honestly, it was kind of mesmerizing.

People went outside, kids started dancing in the streets, and couples just kind of stared up at the sky, totally amazed. It was like the sky was putting on a show just for us. But after a few weeks, we all just sort of got used to it. The glowing rain became normal, like the sunset or something.

Then, out of nowhere, the first major thunderstorm rolled in. The clouds looked super dark and stormy, and everyone whispered nervously, worried about what was coming next. When the rain finally started, it was different again. The glowing orbs flickered brighter and moved in swirling patterns — like the sky was angry or alive or something.

Lightning struck, lighting up the whole town in an unnatural glow, and the thunder was so loud it shook the buildings. Honestly, it was kind of scary but also awesome to watch. We all looked at each other like, “Whoa, this is intense.”

But then, something pretty incredible happened. The rain—despite how crazy and dark it looked—seemed to do something special. Flowers around town started blooming in bright colors, trees seemed to get more vibrant, and the air smelled amazing, almost like magic or like the rain was somehow alive and full of energy.

People started stepping outside and just letting the rain wash over them, like they were getting a new start or something. A lot of us laughed and danced around in the downpour, forgetting our worries for a little while. It felt like the rain was giving us a fresh start or maybe even healing the town.

After the storm finally ended, the glowing rain slowly stopped, and the streets were soaked but everyone was smiling. The storm had changed things — it made us realize how fragile and precious life really is. We started fixing the old playground, planting a community garden, and holding festivals to remember what we went through.

Even now, life isn’t the same. The magic of that storm left a mark on Willowbrook. The rain doesn’t shimmer as much anymore, but we all still remember how incredible that storm was and what it made us see — how powerful nature can be and that sometimes, even the craziest things can remind us of the beauty in the world.
