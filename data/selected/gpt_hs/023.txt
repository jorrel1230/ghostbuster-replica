Okay, so here’s a version of that story but written like an average high school student might say it:

---

Senator Jennifer Thompson was sitting nervously in this dim room, listening to President Johnson talk. He looked kinda serious and said, “Jennifer, what I’m about to tell you isn’t gonna be easy to hear.” She was already feeling kind of nervous, sweating a little, as she paid close attention. Then he said, “For a really long time, American politics has pretty much been a plan to keep the founding fathers spinning in their graves.”

Her eyes got big. She was kinda confused. “Wait, what? Are you serious? So all the fights and stuff we’ve seen, it's just a show? Just a fake drama?”

The President nodded. “Yeah, exactly. The people who made America knew what they were doing—they set up fights, divisions, all to keep the country distracted while the real powers behind the scenes pulled the strings and got richer and more powerful.”

Jennifer couldn’t believe it. She always thought democracy was about the people making a difference, that the system was fair. But if it was all just a lie, that was pretty heartbreaking. “Why would they do that, though? Why mess with everything like that?”

He explained, “The founders were smart, they wanted progress and change, but they also wanted to protect what they’d built. They knew if people got too confident, they might mess up what the country was about. So they made a plan. They knew their names and reputations would inspire pride and loyalty, and that would keep people loyal and patriotic, even if the whole thing was kind of a ‘game’ for those in power.”

Jennifer thought about this for a moment, trying to get it all straight. “So, why are you telling me this now? Why share this secret with me?”

The President looked at her seriously. “Because, Jennifer, you’re different. You don’t just buy into this fake political show. You see past all the tricks and see what America was really supposed to be. That’s something our founding fathers would respect.”

That made her feel kind of inspired. It was a lot to take in—knowing all this secret manipulation was a lot to handle. But she also felt like maybe she could do something about it. “So what do we do now? How do we fix this?”

He leaned back, thinking. “First, we have to go after the people who set all this up. We’ll quietly investigate and work with trustworthy people in the government and media to expose who’s been pulling the strings all these years.”

She was nervous but also determined. “I want to help. I want to restore real democracy, honor what the founders wanted, and make an America that really represents the people’s wishes.”

The President smiled a little. “That’s brave of you, Jennifer. But be careful—the people behind this are powerful. They won’t go down without a fight.”

She straightened up, feeling ready. “I’m ready for whatever’s coming. Together, we’ll find the truth and build a better future for our country.”

When she left the room, she felt like she had a new purpose. All these years of manipulation and lies were behind her. Now, she had the chance to do something real and honor the spirit of the people who started it all. Every step she took felt like she was carrying the weight of their hopes, and it pushed her forward.

The road ahead wouldn’t be easy, but she was determined. With honesty, courage, and a bit of hope, she was ready to face whatever challenges came her way and make the change she believed her country deserved.
