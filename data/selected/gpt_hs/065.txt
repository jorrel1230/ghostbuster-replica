So, it’s the first day of school at Hogwarts, and Harry Potter is sitting on this chair with the sorting hat on his head. He keeps saying “Gryffindor” in his head over and over, like trying to convince himself. The hat sort of pauses for a second, and everyone’s holding their breath, waiting to see where he’ll go. Then the hat shouts out “Slytherin!” and Harry’s heart drops.  

He just sits there, feeling super confused. He was sure he’d get Gryffindor — that house of brave and loyal people he looked up to. But now, he’s being sent to Slytherin, which is known for being all about sneaky, ambitious wizards, not for doing the right thing or being brave. It kind of freaked him out.  

As Harry walks over to the Slytherin table, he hears some whispering and sees people glancing at him all funny. Meanwhile, a few of the kids look a little surprised but kind of friendly. He notices Draco Malfoy sitting there, the guy he met earlier on the train, giving him a little smile like they know something no one else does.  

Over time, Harry starts to realize that Slytherin isn’t just about dark magic and bad stuff. Some of the kids in Slytherin actually aren’t so bad, and Harry finds that he can kind of be himself there too. He and Draco, plus some others, end up challenging old ideas and making new friends.  

Honestly, sometimes getting put somewhere you don’t expect makes you find out more about yourself. Harry shows that even in a house that everyone thinks is evil, you can be brave and good. And that true friendship and courage can grow in the most unlikely places.
