I was just chillin’ in my little apartment when I started hearing sirens go crazy outside. I looked out the window and, man, the streets looked chaos. People were running everywhere, some screaming, some just staggering around like zombies themselves. It was obvious something really bad was happening — turns out, the zombie outbreak was starting, and my town was already getting overrun.

My heart started pounding. I knew I had to do something quick. I grabbed a backpack and threw in some food, water, and a bunch of clothes — enough to last a few days just in case. My mind was racing. I couldn’t stay here surrounded by all those monsters.  

I pushed open my apartment door and started heading out. In the hallway, I saw a couple of zombies crawling towards me. I grabbed a broom that was nearby and swung at them, trying to hit them away. It was close — their gross faces were right in front of mine. I shoved past them and ran down the stairs as fast as I could, finally throwing open the front door and bolting outside.

Outside, things were crazy. The streets I used to know were now like a maze filled with zombies. I knew I had to find some place safe — somewhere I could hide and wait until maybe someone comes for us, if that ever happens.  

As I was running, I saw a flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye. It was a small group of survivors, huddled near a hardware store. They waved at me and motioned for me to come over. They grabbed my arm and pulled me inside their makeshift shelter, pushing furniture and stuff against the door to block it.  

We didn’t really have time to talk much because we all knew we had to move fast. They told me they’d been stuck there for hours, just trying to figure out what to do. Right now, all we could hope for was to get a vehicle and haul out of town — rumor had it there was some safe bunker in the next town over.  

We looked around for a vehicle, all of us super nervous and freaked out. Finally, we found an old van — almost falling apart, but it still had the keys in the ignition. I hesitated for just a second, then turned the engine on. The thing roared to life, and I felt a little bit of hope.  

One after another, we piled into the van, all of us knowing we needed to stick together if we were gonna make it. As we drove away, the streets behind us faded into the distance, like a bad dream we were leaving behind. The road ahead was totally unknown, but we held on to the hope that maybe, just maybe, we’d make it out alive.
