So, imagine this: you’re in a really tense situation, and instead of shooting the robot clone, you accidentally shoot your friend, Alex. Yeah, it’s basically a nightmare. 

That’s exactly what happened to Mark. He just stared at Alex’s body on the ground, totally in shock. His hands were shaking like crazy, and he was freaked out because he realized he hadn’t shot the robot but his friend. He dropped the gun, his mind racing and heart pounding. Sweat was pouring down his face as he got down next to Alex, hoping maybe, just maybe, he was still alive. But everything felt wrong. How did he mess up so badly?

He grabbed his phone with shaky hands and called 911, crying and trying to explain what had happened, but it was hard to get the words out. It felt like forever until he heard the sirens coming closer. When the paramedics finally arrived, Mark just stood there, overwhelmed with guilt and sadness. He knew he’d have to face what he did, but deep down he kept telling himself maybe it was just a mistake—that maybe he didn’t shoot Alex, but the robot duplicate instead. It was a small hope, but he clung to it, determined to find out what really happened.

Every day after that, Mark visited Alex in the hospital, crying and apologizing, wishing his friend would wake up. But days turned into weeks, then a month, and there was still no change. The guilt was eating him up from inside, and he felt like he might just break.

In his desperation, Mark started doing his own detective work, checking out the pieces of the robot leftover and trying to figure out if something went wrong. He spent sleepless nights, but eventually, he found a glitch in the robot's program. It turned out that when attacked, the robot paused for a second, which could’ve been a chance for a human to escape – maybe that’s how Alex survived or how the mistake happened.

Now feeling a tiny bit hopeful, Mark showed what he found to the police and fought to prove he didn’t mean to shoot Alex. After some investigation, the court realized it was just a horrible accident, and Mark wasn't to blame. It still hurt, but at least he knew he fought for the truth and that Alex’s spirit could rest peacefully.

Even though he’s haunted by what happened, Mark decided to dedicate his life to raising awareness about this kind of robot technology so no one else would go through the same pain. Through all this, he kept Alex’s memory close, promising to honor his friend and his friendship forever.
