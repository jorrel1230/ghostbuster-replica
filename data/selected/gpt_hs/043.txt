Honestly, I think I’d be really lucky if I got a bracelet that glowed brighter the closer I got to something that could kill me. Like, everyone else’s bracelet would start glowing more and more, but mine? It never did anything. It just stayed the same, shiny and silver, and I kind of just ignored it most of the time. I figured maybe I was one of the lucky ones or maybe the thing was broken. I didn’t really think much of it, and honestly, I was kind of okay with not having to worry about it glowing and making me paranoid.

But then, one day, I was walking through the busy city streets, and I saw this person who looked pretty lost in the crowd. They were kind of freaking out with their hands moving around a lot, looking around nervously. The weirdest part was their bracelet. It was glowing super bright—way more than anyone else’s I’d seen. It was as if a tiny star was wrapped around their wrist or something. I couldn’t help but stare.

Something made me go over to them. Maybe it was curiosity, or maybe I just felt like I needed to know what was up. When I got close, our eyes met, and I got this weird feeling like we understood each other without even talking. It was one of those moments where you realize things are about to change.

“Uh, your bracelet,” I blurted out, kind of surprised myself. “It’s always glowing?”

They looked at me with kind of a sad face, almost tired. “Yeah,” they said, their voice heavy, like they’d been through a lot. “It’s never stopped shining since I got it.”

Hearing that made me feel kind of guilty. Here I was, whining about my bracelet never glowing, and this person had to live with it constantly lit up, reminding them that they might die at any moment. It was a weird feeling—like I’d taken my luck for granted.

We kept walking through the city, and they started telling me stories about their life with that bracelet. How it had led them through so many dangerous situations, how close they’d come to dying more times than they could count. They talked about narrow escapes, crazy coincidences, and always being on edge. Every time they looked at their glowing bracelet, it was like they knew death was always nearby.

Finally, I asked, “Why are you still trying? What’s your point?”

They laughed a little, but it wasn’t a happy laugh. “Even in darkness, you can find hope,” they said softly. “My goal is to find some kind of light—something that can save us all or at least give us a reason to keep going.”

Their words hit me hard. I started thinking about what I’d been doing with my life. I’d never really felt like I had a purpose, but maybe, just maybe, I did. Maybe that bracelet, even if it never glowed, was still a sign that I could do something meaningful. Instead of being lucky or unlucky, it could mean I had a chance to help others, to give them hope when they needed it most.

From that moment on, I decided to join them on their mission. We went to the dark places, the lonely people, those hopeless situations. We helped people who were sick or sad or just lost. It felt good to do something that mattered, to be someone who could maybe make a difference, even if my bracelet never lit up.

In the end, I realized that the glow of the bracelet isn’t what makes someone special. Maybe it’s what you do with it that counts. I may not have had a glowing bracelet, but I’d found something even better— a reason to keep going and a way to shine for others. And that’s the real purpose, I think.
