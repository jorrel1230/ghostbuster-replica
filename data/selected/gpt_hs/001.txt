The night was super dark, with no moon shining at all, and I was walking through our small town. The streets were empty and kinda creepy, and every step I took on the old cobblestones made my chest feel heavy, like I was carrying the world. Honestly, I felt scared, guilty, and hungry all at once, like I was just sinking deeper into some dark hole inside me.

I used to be just like everyone else here, part of this close community, but now I feel like I’ve been completely pulled into darkness. Nobody really knew where I came from or what I was dealing with. I have this weird hunger inside me that I just can't ignore, no matter how much I try. For years, I kept everything hidden, blending in with everyone, hiding what I really am.

That night, I got curious about the old Pendlebrook house. I’d heard stories about it, and though I’d seen creepy stuff before, this place seemed different – like it was hiding even darker secrets. The wind was whispering to me, almost calling me to go closer. My instincts told me to run away, but I kept going, hoping I’d find a way to break whatever curse was making me this way.

What I didn’t know was that the Pendlebrooks had their own dark past. When I found an old journal, I read that their wealth wasn’t exactly clean – it was built on blood and worse stuff. Their twisted hunger had been buried deep for years. Some weird connection pulled me toward them, even if I didn’t realize it at first.

As I sneaked inside the mansion, I kept hearing a faint humming sound. It was strange, almost hypnotic. I followed it, and finally, I found a hidden room. There, I saw the old patriarch of the Pendlebrooks. He looked terrible – shriveled and old, kept alive by some creepy rituals that had gone on for centuries.

Seeing him like that made me feel kinda bad. He wasn’t the proud guy I remembered; now he looked desperate for some way to stay alive forever. I saw myself in him — I get what it means to be so hungry you can’t stop, and it scared me what might happen to me if I kept going down this road.

Without really thinking, I stepped closer and reached out my hand. I wanted to help him, maybe try to find some hope for both of us. To my surprise, his eyes finally opened wide — like he’d seen a flicker of hope. That’s when I thought maybe I could help him, and maybe we could find a way out of this nightmare together.

I had a simple plan. I thought if I took him under my wing, maybe we could find some kind of cure. Maybe, just maybe, we could change what we were — find redemption, you know? We spent months digging through strange books and ancient scrolls, trying to find something that could turn our cursed hunger into something good.

One day, we found this dark-looking potion that claimed to turn evil urges into something positive. Without thinking too much, we mixed it up — hope and desperation mixed together — and drank it at the same time, waiting for some kind of miracle to happen.

But it was a trap. The potion was corrupted, twisted by some dark force, and it wasn’t meant to help us. As Pendlebrook’s body gave out and he died, I realized what had really happened — I had been tricked. We wanted salvation, but instead, we’d just handed over our souls to some evil master. 

The pain hit me hard, and my own monstrous side exploded out. The potion made me worse — way worse. It made my hunger so strong I couldn’t control it anymore. That’s when I understood I had doomed myself to be like this — a monster with no way back. 

But the worst part is, I stopped caring about feeling sorry for myself. Now, I enjoy hurting people. What I wanted for myself — to be free — ended up destroying a lot of others instead. The townspeople I once knew, my neighbors, they’re now just prey for me. I hunt them down because I can’t stop myself anymore.

Now, I walk these streets alone, weighed down by guilt and regret. But honestly, I don’t feel guilty anymore. I’m just a monster, haunted by what I lost and what I’ve become. This story is a warning — not all monsters are born like this. Sometimes, it’s the good intentions that turn into something terrible when things go wrong.
