Wow, so here’s the story. I’m Arianna, a human born on Mars, and today I want to tell you about what happened after a hundred years of US taking over our planet. Honestly, it’s kind of crazy to think how long we’ve been under their control, but now, everything is changing.

So, picture this: we’re in this crowded war room, all my friends and I, just totally serious but also kind of excited. We’ve been waiting for this moment forever. After all these years of being forced to follow Earth’s rules, it’s finally time for Mars to be free. I could see the fire in everyone’s eyes—it gave me hope, like we could actually do this.

Our army, all of us standing together, was ready. We carried our weapons and all our hopes for the future. Out of the underground tunnels where we hid, we marched toward the US base. It was kinda surreal — like we were about to make history. When I looked up at the red sky, which had this crazy glow because of the Sun, I felt like everything was about to change.

We made our move, and we declared that Mars was no longer part of the US. The words echoed across the planet, and it felt like even the stars seemed to be shining a little brighter. For weeks, we fought really hard. The other side had all this high-tech stuff, but we didn’t give up. Our passion and stubbornness just kept growing. More and more Martian-born humans joined us, wanting freedom too.

Eventually, we won. The US flag was lowered, and everyone saw the new one—red and black, representing Mars. It was a huge moment. Now, Mars is free from being controlled by another planet. We’ve built our own society where Martians can thrive. We still work with Earth, but now, we’re on equal footing.

Looking back, I can’t believe we actually did it. After a hundred years of dreaming and fighting, Mars is finally independent. Standing here, watching our planet from afar, I feel like the universe saw us do something really incredible — we proved that the human spirit can’t be crushed. And honestly, I’m just so proud of what we pulled off.
