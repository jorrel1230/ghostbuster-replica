When I walked into the room, it was pretty dark and kinda creepy, but I could feel something exciting in the air. I was at a gang fair, which is kind of like a college fair but for gangs. They had tables set up with posters, flyers, and stuff talking about why you should join their gang. I was just there to see if I could find a gang that might be the right fit for me.

At first, I looked around and saw some gangs that were all about fighting and violence. One group was called "The Ravens," and their posters showed guys punching and fighting. They were proud of their street fighting skills. Another gang, "The Phoenix," bragged about dealing drugs and living a fancy lifestyle, with pictures of cars and money. Honestly, I wasn't really interested in all that show-off stuff.

Then I found a table that caught my attention—"The Scholars." Instead of weapons and tough guys, their table had books and some calm-looking people. A guy there gave me a flyer with quotes from famous leaders and talked about helping out in poor neighborhoods. I decided to stay and listen, even though I hadn’t planned on it.

The leader of The Scholars was pretty cool. He talked about fixing social problems, helping communities, and giving people chances to improve their lives. It wasn’t just about fighting or drugs—it felt like they cared about making real change. I started to think maybe this was the gang I wanted to join.

I could see myself working with these guys, trying to make things better and stand against all the bad stuff happening around us. I got excited and went over to their representative and signed up. It made me realize that gang fairs aren’t just about fighting or looking tough—they’re kinda like figuring out what you wanna do with your life, like picking a college. 

In that moment, I learned that even in a place that seems all about gangs, you can find a way to do good and make a difference. Maybe this was the start of something better for me.
