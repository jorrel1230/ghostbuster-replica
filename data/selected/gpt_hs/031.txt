So, when I took my last breath, everything just kind of went black. It was like nothingness. Then, out of nowhere, I woke up. But I wasn’t in my body anymore—I was this tiny, super fragile baby. At first, I was totally confused, like, what just happened? I didn’t get it. I looked around, but I couldn’t do anything. I had no control over anything that was happening to this kid. It was really weird because the years just went by, and I couldn’t do anything to stop it or help.

As I got older, I started to see everything from a distance. Like, I watched myself grow up—the good times, the bad times, the mistakes. I wanted to tell this kid what to do or try to protect them, but I couldn’t. I was just stuck watching, feeling kinda helpless. It was frustrating because I knew this kid was actually me, but I couldn’t reach him.

Then, one day, it hit me—I was this kid. Somehow, I had become my own conscience inside the body I used to have. All my regrets and screw-ups from before hit me hard, watching them happen all over again. But this time, I started to see things differently. I learned that forgiving myself was really important. I started to appreciate the small, simple moments in life—stuff I hadn’t noticed before. 

As the years went on, I understood how complicated life could be. I realized I had the power to forgive, to grow, and to learn, even if I didn’t have control over everything. I found comfort in knowing that I was given a second chance—to be a better person this time around. Honestly, it was kind of a relief to think that, even though I was just a kid, I could still make some kind of difference—kind of healing myself and maybe even others.

In the end, I saw that even as a kid, I had the power to change, to heal, and to become someone better. And that thought gave me hope that maybe, just maybe, I could make the most of this second shot at life.
