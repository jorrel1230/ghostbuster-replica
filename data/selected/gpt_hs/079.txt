I used to be totally sure I was the bad guy in this story, like I had a job to cause chaos and be the villain. But after what the protagonist did, I honestly started to doubt everything. They did something unexpectedly kind, like way more than I thought they would, and it messed with my head. It was like they broke the rules of the story, blurting out a side I didn’t see coming. I wasn’t sure if I was still the bad guy or just something else now. Part of me felt annoyed, but another part kind of admired what they did. Whatever it was, I knew one thing for sure — they changed the way I see everything, and now I don’t know if I’m really the villain anymore.
