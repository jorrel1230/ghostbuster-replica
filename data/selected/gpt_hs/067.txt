So, like, I never thought I’d end up with a weird curse, but here we are. Basically, I got cursed to only talk in rhymes, which is kind of annoying but also kind of funny. Every time I try to say something normal, it just comes out in verse. Not exactly what I needed for work or home, you know?

First, I had to tell my boss about it. I was pretty nervous, but I figured honesty was the best way. So, I went up to him and said, "Boss, I have a strange thing, I can't help but rhyme, it's like a spell, and I’m stuck in this rhyme time." He looked kind of surprised but then he started laughing. He thought it was funny and told me I could take the night off, saying I looked like I needed a break from all this poetic stuff.

Then I had to talk to my spouse about it. I was worried they'd be annoyed or weirded out, but I just explained what was happening. At first, they were confused—like, “What do you mean, you’re rhyming all the time?” But after a bit, they understood that this was just how I was now, kinda like a part of me.

And then, I had to tell my classmates. It was awkward at first, standing in front of everyone and explaining everything in rhyme. But surprisingly, they thought it was pretty funny. It turned into a little game, and we even joked around with rhymes during class. It actually made school a lot more interesting.

Honestly, after a while, I started to see the upside. Rhyming kind of became my thing, my weird superpower. Maybe I wanted to be normal, but I also learned to enjoy the odd way I was speaking now. It kind of made me appreciate words and how cool they can be.

So, if you ever find yourself with a crazy curse like mine, just go with it. Talk in rhyme, make it fun, and don’t be scared to stand out. Sometimes, being different can turn into something pretty cool. Just remember to embrace it and see where it takes you!
