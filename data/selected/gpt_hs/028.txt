I woke up when the clock hit midnight, and honestly, I felt pretty nervous. I looked at myself in the mirror and freaked out because my chest number had changed from “1” to “3 million.” My chest number is supposed to show how many people I’ll kill in the next month, so this was terrifying. My heart was racing, and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I kept wondering if I could do anything to stop all that from happening, but then I thought maybe I can change my future. I did some quick research and found out that this number actually meant a huge disaster was coming, and that decisions in a second could affect lots of lives. I felt desperate but also kind of hopeful, so I decided I had to do something to make things better, to try and stop all that bad stuff from happening.
