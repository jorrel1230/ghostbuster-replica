Growing up, everything was pretty normal at first. Then, my parents had another kid, my baby sister Evangeline. When she was born, everyone said she was so tiny and perfect. But weird thing was, no matter how much time passed, she never seemed to grow up. Like, she stayed the same age forever. while I was getting taller, losing my baby fat, and starting to understand more about the world, Evangeline just stayed a little baby, with chubby cheeks and a sweet voice.

It was kind of strange watching her stay the same while everything else changed around us. My friends started moving on, getting jobs or talking about college and other big stuff. But with Evangeline, it was like we were stuck in our own little bubble. We still played tag, had sleepovers, and told silly secrets late at night. Our family was kind of like a weird loop where time just didn’t seem to affect her.

Honestly, I don’t really get why she doesn’t grow. Sometimes I wonder if she’ll stay like that forever. But I don’t mind most of the time. It’s kind of nice having someone who’s always the same tiny, happy kid. We sort of became like a team, just chilling and doing our thing, no matter how old I get. And when the sunsets paint the sky, Evangeline and I still run around playing like we’re little kids forever.
