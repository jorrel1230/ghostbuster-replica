So, I found out I suddenly had this crazy power where I could control anyone I wanted. At first, it felt kinda weird, but also kind of cool. I picked a random person walking by and told him to do something, and surprisingly, his body just did what I said. But then, out of nowhere, I started hearing his thoughts in my head. He was like, *What are you doing to me? Please, just let me go!* It was super freaky. I instantly felt bad and let him go right away. After that, I decided I’d only use my power when I really had to. I started paying attention to what their thoughts and feelings were, almost like I could hear their hopes and fears. It made me realize that having this kind of power wasn’t just about messing around — it made me see how human everyone really is, and I learned that with great power comes a lot of responsibility.
