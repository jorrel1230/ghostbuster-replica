Hey Lily,

By the time you get this, I’ll probably be gone. I’m really sorry to tell you this, but I caught this really bad virus and the doctors say there’s no way to stop it. They say I don’t have much time left, and soon I’ll be gone.  

I’ve been fighting as hard as I can to stay alive these past few days, but the virus keeps taking over, and I have to accept that I might not make it. It’s kinda hard to believe, but I know I won’t be here much longer.  

Lily, you’ve been my everything. You’re the reason I smile and the reason I look forward to each day. I thank God every day for bringing you into my life and for the love we shared. Even though I’m sick, all the memories we made together will stay with me forever.  

Writing these letters to you has been a small comfort, like a way to keep you close to me even when I can’t be there. I don’t write this with despair, but more with acceptance. I want you to know that it’s okay, and you shouldn’t blame yourself for any of this. Sometimes life throws the worst challenges at us, and I think this is one of those times.  

Please cherish the time we had, and remember that our love was special. You brought so much happiness into my life, and I’ll be grateful for that forever. Even if I’m not here anymore, I want you to keep living happily, chasing your dreams, and loving deeply, just like we did.  

In these last days, I’ve thought a lot about what really matters. It’s not how long we live, but how much love and good moments we share with people we care about. I’ll hold onto all our laughs, adventures, and love, and I hope you will too.  

Don’t let yourself be overwhelmed by sadness, Lily. Keep going and don’t forget to enjoy life. I want you to live a life full of happiness and purpose. You’re strong, and I believe in you. Let my passing remind you that even in darkness, there’s still light worth holding onto.  

As I say goodbye, I want you to know I’m at peace now. I’ve accepted what’s happening, and I can finally rest. I’ll be watching over you, guiding you when things get tough, and walking with you on your path.  

Remember, Lily, real love never really ends. Even though I won’t be with you physically, the love we shared will stay with us forever.  

Thank you for everything, Lily. I love you more than words can say, and I will love you always—until my last breath and beyond.  

All my love,  
Thomas
