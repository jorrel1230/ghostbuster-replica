Sure! Here's a simplified, more casual version of the essay, like how an average high school student might write it:

---

When I first walked into that cold, dimly lit room, I was so nervous. I honestly thought I was about to be executed. It felt like everything was just falling apart, and I didn't know what was gonna happen next. As soon as the iron door slammed shut behind me, I felt the heavy weight of all I had done.

The room was super quiet. It felt like forever before I heard footsteps coming down the hall. Then a man in a sharp suit walked in, holding some papers. His face looked serious but kind of made me think he understood what I was feeling.

"Welcome," he said, his voice calm but serious. "I have some news—you’re not going to be executed anymore."

I was totally confused. "Wait, what? You mean... the death penalty? It's gone?"

"Yeah," he nodded. "The death sentence has been abolished years ago. It doesn’t really happen anymore. Now, it’s mostly just a way to scare people from doing really bad crimes. But they don't actually carry out executions now."

I couldn’t believe it. I sat there, trying to process what he just said. "So... what now? What's gonna happen to me?"

The man reached into his folder and pulled out a new passport and some papers. "We’re giving you a new identity. You’re free to start over, go somewhere else, and build a new life. Leave the past behind."

My heart was pounding so hard. It felt like I got a second chance at life, even though I knew I’d done a lot wrong. It was weird — part of me felt guilty, but another part was kinda hopeful.

"Thank you," I said, my voice trembling.

He nodded at me. "Use this chance wisely. Do something good with it."

As I left that room, I felt a strange feeling — like a huge weight was off my shoulders. Outside, everything looked so lively. The sun was shining like it was welcoming me back to real life.

I moved to a small beach town and got a simple job helping out at an animal shelter. I started caring for abandoned pets, and honestly, it felt kinda ironic — I used to do really bad stuff, and now I was helping animals. It gave me a weird kind of peace.

Over time, I got used to this new life. I met nice people who didn’t know anything about my past, and I made real friends. The guilt I carried started to fade, replaced with a feeling of — I don’t know — redemption.

But sometimes I wondered, why did the government get rid of the death penalty? It’s supposed to stop violent crimes, but what about forgiving and helping people change? Maybe those things are just as important, if not more.

Deep down, I believe that everyone can change — if they’re given the chance. That’s why I’ve made it my mission to support a justice system that focuses on healing instead of just punishing.

Years later, I even spoke in front of a crowd about my story. I told them about how I turned things around. That creepy execution room still sticks in my head, but it doesn’t control me anymore. I found my purpose — to show how messed up systems can overlook our humanity.

As people clapped, I smiled. My past helped shape who I am today — someone who wants to see change. The death penalty is gone, but its shadow still lingers. And I want to make sure everyone gets a second chance at life.
