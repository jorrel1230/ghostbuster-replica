I always believed that there was someone out there meant for me, like in those movies. I thought love was supposed to be perfect, and I would find someone who completes me. Everyone has the last words of their soulmate written on their body, and mine says "I never loved you." At first, I couldn’t believe it. I mean, how could someone I’m supposed to love forever say that? It kinda felt like some cruel joke from fate, and it made me feel terrible inside.

Reading those words every day just made me feel more sad and lonely. I started to stay by myself more, kind of hiding from everything. My days felt super dull, and I struggled to find anything that made me feel better. The words on my skin just remind me of how hurt I am.

But after a while, I started thinking about it differently. I realized that those words don’t actually define me. Just because my soulmate never loved me doesn’t mean I can’t love myself or find happiness. I decided I wasn’t gonna let those words control my life anymore. Instead, I focused on myself — my passions, my friends, my family — the people who actually care about me. It helped me see that I have the power to heal my own heart and change how I feel about everything.

Eventually, the pain from those words started to fade. I became stronger and more confident. Maybe my soulmate will never love me back, and that’s okay. I’ve learned to love myself and to keep going, no matter what. My scars, both physical and emotional, I guess, tell a story of surviving and growing. They remind me that even after pain, there’s always hope and strength inside me.

So yeah, even though the last words of my soulmate are "I never loved you," I’ve learned that I don’t need someone else’s love to be happy. I can find happiness within myself.
