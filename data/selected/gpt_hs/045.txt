When the plane started to lift off, I could feel my heart pounding because I was so nervous. Just a few minutes before, I found out that I had finally done it—my biggest dream was to become a published author, and I actually made it happen. The crazy part is, with that achievement, I got this weird bonus: I could read minds. At first, I was totally hyped about it, but then I started feeling kind of overwhelmed. As the plane went higher, I could hear all these random thoughts from the people around me, and it made me feel anxious and insecure. I started sweating like crazy, realizing how much power I had and how heavy it felt. Honestly, it kind of freaked me out at first. But then I told myself I’d try to use this ability to understand people better and help them, instead of freaking out about it. It’s like, even with all the chaos, I want to use it for good and maybe make a difference in someone’s life.
