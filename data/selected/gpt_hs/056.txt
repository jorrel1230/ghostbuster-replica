The first time she called me "mama," I was so happy. Her little voice sounded so innocent and full of love, like she trusted me completely. I promised I’d always protect her no matter what. Years went by, and she got taller, more curious and full of laughter, but then everything started to change. The world wasn’t kind to her. People called her a monster just because she was defending herself against those who hurt her. The last time she said "mama," she sounded scared and broken, like she was in a lot of pain. The world betrayed her and twisted everything around. When they took her away for good, I felt like my heart broke into a million pieces. I was so devastated, but I promised I’d keep fighting for her and for justice, so her memory wouldn’t be erased.
