The rain was coming down so hard outside, it felt like the whole city was soaked in sadness. I was sitting in this small, dim room, face-to-face with my latest guy – everyone just calls him ‘The Whisper’. He owed a lot to the boss, and it was my job to get him to pay up, no matter what. People knew me as “The Interrogator” because I’m pretty good at making people talk. But this time, there was something different going on because he only had one word left that he could say before… well, before he runs out of words and dies.

In this messed-up world, your lifespan depends on how many words you have left. You’re born with a certain amount, and when those words run out, you’re finished. I, on the other hand, was given millions of extra words – an exception made by the boss, probably so I could do my job better. But now, that’s kind of backfiring because my mark, The Whisper, only had one word left.

He was sitting there, sweating and shaking, clearly scared out of his mind. His eyes kept flickering around, looking for some way out that didn’t exist. 'The Whisper' got his name because he was quiet and ruthless, kind of scary. But now, he was basically about to run out of words and face death. 

I lit a cigarette to fill the heavy silence. It was something I did to calm myself and probably to make him more nervous. I knew I had to finish this fast. I leaned in a little and whispered, “One word left, Whisper. Just one. Make it count.”

He looked at me, desperate and pretty much resigned to whatever was coming. I’d seen that look before, but never in this kind of situation. He was holding his last words on his tongue, and I could see it was killing him. Finally, in a tiny voice barely louder than a whisper, he said, “Why?”

The room got quiet again, only the sounds of the rain hitting the windows. My mind was swirling. ‘Why?’ That was a question that made me pause even with time running out. Maybe there was a way to save him, a loophole or something I hadn’t seen yet. 

I reached into my pocket and pulled out this old, battered notebook. It’s got pages of words I’ve written down over the years. That’s my secret weapon. While other people have to be careful with what they say, I can write down anything I want, and those words can be passed on, maybe even save someone if they’re on the verge of dying. 

I flipped through the pages, trying to find the perfect word that might stop him from dying. And then, like a tiny whisper in my head, I saw it. “Silence.” I scribbled it quickly onto a scrap of paper and slid it across the table to him. 

His eyes shot wide open when he saw it, hope flashing in them like a candle in the dark. A tear slid down his cheek as he read the word. But before he could ask what it meant, I held up my hand and stopped him. My voice, which is usually pretty confident, felt shaky. “Write this down, Whisper. It will give you silence in every way. No more talking. No more words — just silence. It’ll save your life.”

He looked at the paper for a second, thinking about what it meant. Then he nodded, looking grateful. With that, he took a deep breath, getting ready to face a life without words. 

When I left and the door creaked shut behind me, I wondered what was going to happen to him. Would silence give him peace, or would it drive him crazy? Did I actually save him, or just give him more suffering? The rain kept falling, washing everything away — including the echoes of what we’d said. 

One thing I was sure of: even though I’d helped him stay alive, carrying the weight of his silence was starting to mess with me. That’s just how this life works. Words are precious, and when they're gone, it’s like, what’s left? A lot of empty space. That’s the deal I’ve made — living in a world where even one word can make a difference, and not saying anything at all can be a punishment.
