In the small town by the coast called Serenity Bay, there was a really nice guy named Samuel. Everyone loved his laugh and how his smile made you feel better, even on bad days. Samuel had something pretty cool — he had a third way of existing. It’s like, instead of just living and then dying, he stayed around as long as people still remembered him.

For a long time, Samuel was kind of like the heart of the town. He was always helping people and doing good things. Everyone admired him because he was so caring. As long as people kept remembering him, he kind of lived on in a way. That was his third form of life—it wasn’t just about being alive or dead, but about how people still held onto his memory.

But over the years, things started to change. The town got busier, people got distracted with their problems, and slowly, they started forgetting about Samuel. The more time went on, the more his name and deeds faded into the background. One day, when the last person who still remembered Samuel forgot about him, he disappeared completely. His third form of existence ended.

It’s kinda sad, but it’s also kinda interesting — because after Samuel was gone, people started to realize how much he had mattered. His kindness left a mark on their hearts, even after they forgot his name. That made them see how important it is to remember the people who helped us and made a difference in our lives. Memories, they realized, are like threads that keep people connected even after they’re gone.

After that, Serenity Bay learned that they should never forget the good people who did nice things for others. They promised to keep Samuel's memory alive by acting kindly and appreciating each other. This way, no one would ever truly be gone—because as long as people remember them, their spirit lives on.

As more years passed, new kids grew up hearing stories about Samuel. His story became part of the town’s history, so he would never be forgotten. And in the end, Samuel’s spirit seemed to stay alive in everyone’s hearts, reminding them of the power of kindness and how important it is to remember those who made a difference.
