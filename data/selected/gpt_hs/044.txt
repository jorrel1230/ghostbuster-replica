When I walked out of the time machine, I saw this super pretty village in feudal Japan. I was honestly pretty excited to be there and started exploring the place. Little did I know, I was about to find out that what I thought was just movies and comics wasn’t totally made up.

As I moved around the village, I came across vendors selling stuff from the 1980s about ninjas. So of course, I bought a bunch of movies and comic books to check out. When I started reading and watching them, I was kinda blown away because the way they showed ninjas was actually pretty accurate.

The ninjas in these stories were shown as super skilled in hiding and sneaking around. They could blend into shadows, move quietly, and do crazy martial arts. It was honestly like whoever made these movies and comics knew a lot about what ninjas really did back then.

Curious about how this was possible, I asked an old man in the village who seemed to know a lot about history. He told me a crazy story: apparently, in the late 1800s, a group of time travelers from the 1980s had somehow come back to this era. They spent time watching the real ninjas and then, when they went back to their own time, they made media that was super true to how ninjas actually fought and moved.

Wow, hearing that kinda made me think. I realized that maybe, just maybe, my being here somehow influenced how future generations saw ninjas. It was pretty cool thinking that 1980s movies and comics somehow captured the real essence of ninja skills. I started to see this world in a new way and just appreciated that the stories from the 1980s were more than just fiction—they actually kept the real ninja spirit alive.
