I woke up suddenly, my heart pounding super fast, and there was the devil just standing at the foot of my bed. His creepy red eyes locked onto mine, and I couldn’t even move or catch my breath for a second. It felt like time just froze. 

Then, out of nowhere, he tapped my foot lightly and smiled all weird. He whispered, “You’re it,” and then just dissolved into smoke. I was totally freaked out and confused – like, what just happened?

Days went by, but I kept thinking about that weird moment. “You’re it?” What did that even mean? I started reading tons of books, searching online, trying to figure out if it was some kind of magic or some creepy legend. Honestly, I just wanted to understand what was going on.

Turns out, I think I was meant to be the chosen one or something like that. Like I got some kind of special power to fight evil and keep things balanced. It was kind of scary but also kind of cool. It felt like I was getting ready to fight monsters and demons and all that dark stuff that’s lurking around.

At first, I was pretty scared about all this. But after a while, I felt more determined. The devil’s visit pushed me to become stronger—physically and mentally. I started training, trying to get ready for whatever evil might come my way. I decided I had a purpose now: to stand up and fight the darkness.

Over the years, I kept going, even when it was super hard. Every fight was tough, but I never gave up. Sometimes I’d think about the devil’s creepy eyes, and that would give me the push to keep going. It turned me into someone tougher, someone who wouldn’t back down.

Now, I feel like I’ve become someone who protects others and fights for good. I’m kind of like a hero in my own way. The devil may have picked me that morning, but I’ve chosen to do something big, to make a difference. From that moment on, I showed everyone—and myself—that I could be stronger than that evil presence.
