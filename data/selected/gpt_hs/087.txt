I’ve always kinda believed that cheating can be powerful. Like, ever since I was in school, I thought if you knew how to cheat, you could get ahead in everything—tests, work, life. I was part of a secret group of cheaters who helped each other out. We were pretty good at bending the rules and making things easier for ourselves.

Our group was made up of people from all different backgrounds. We all agreed that if you can cheat your way through school and work, you’re basically surviving in life itself. We looked out for each other, sharing tips and tricks so we could all get by easier. It felt like we were in some secret society, bonded by this shared idea that life should be less hard and more... cheatable.

But then, everything changed. I found out that one of our members was cheating death itself. Like, he was actually trying to cheat death. The news spread fast, and honestly, I couldn’t believe it at first. Cheating death? That’s a whole other level. It just didn’t make sense with what we stood for. We were all about sneaking past exams or getting promotions by cheating—but interfering with life and death? That’s way beyond that.

I knew I had to find out who was behind it, so I started looking around. Turns out, it was a guy named Adrian. He was kind of a mysterious figure in our group—hardly anyone saw him, but everyone knew he was super good at cheating. I tracked him down to this little cabin deep in the woods, super remote and kind of creepy.

When I finally got inside, I saw Adrian standing in front of a wall filled with weird formulas, symbols, and old books. It kind of freaked me out. We started talking, and I asked him why he was risking everything like this. He said he wasn’t doing it out of arrogance but because he wanted to save the people he loved. Honestly, it was kinda hard to blame him, because who wouldn’t want to cheat death if they could?

Adrian had found this forbidden book that talked about a secret “realm,” a way to manipulate the natural order. He thought maybe he could cheat death, give people longer lives—basically, cheat the final thing we all have to face. He said he’d saved a lot of lives, but he paid for it in loneliness because nobody could really be around him forever.

I was skeptic but also curious, so I decided to help him out. We looked into all these rituals and spells, and experimented with animals first to see what happened. At first, it seemed to work, and that made us think maybe cheating death wasn’t totally wrong. Maybe it was possible to do this without messing everything up.

But of course, things got messy. Strange accidents started happening around us—things that didn’t make sense. We realized that messing with death was messing with reality itself. It came with a cost, and it was dangerous.

Adrian admitted he knew that, but he was so desperate to save those he loved that he went ahead anyway. We both decided to stop, realizing that playing with forces we didn’t understand was dangerous. We’d crossed a line, and now we just wanted to fix things.

After all of that cheating in school, life, and even death, I finally saw that the real power isn’t about breaking rules but about facing challenges honestly. We decided to end our group and just focus on working hard and doing things the right way.

Years went by, and the group became just a distant memory. Adrian disappeared too, probably trying to find peace after all the chaos. But the lessons from those days stuck with me – cheating isn’t a lasting solution. It’s just a quick fix that can lead to disaster in the end.

I learned that life isn’t something you should cheat from, but something to go through honestly. And even though we made mistakes, we found our way back and realized that cheating ourselves is the worst betrayal of all.
