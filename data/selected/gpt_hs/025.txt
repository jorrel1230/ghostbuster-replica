So, there was this high school reunion happening at Westridge High, and I was kinda nervous to go. It’s been like ten years since we all graduated, and honestly I wasn’t sure what to expect. When I got there, the place was buzzing with old songs, laughter, and just that weird feeling of seeing people you haven’t seen in forever. I looked around, trying to spot my friend Alex.

Finally, I saw someone looking right at me across the room, and our eyes met. Before I knew it, we were running towards each other and hugging tight. “Emma! It’s been forever!” Alex said, actually smiling with genuine happiness.

It felt kinda surreal, seeing Alex after all this time. We talked about how things had been, but honestly, I wasn’t sure how to start. I cleared my throat and asked, “So… how’ve the last ten years been for you?”

Alex took a deep breath and paused for a second. “Oh, you know, good days and bad days. Life threw some stuff my way, but I managed to get through it,” they said, sounding kinda serious but also a little guarded.

That made me curious. “Like, what kind of stuff?” I asked, just trying to understand better.

Alex hesitated, then said, “Let’s just say I’ve had some personal struggles. But I’ve fought my way through them. It hasn’t been easy, but I’m proud of how far I’ve come.”

I could tell Alex wasn’t telling me everything, but I didn’t want to push. I figure everyone has their own battles, so I just nodded and changed the subject to my own weird rollercoaster of a life—how I’ve been trying to figure myself out and all that.

As the night went on, Alex kept talking about overcoming tough times and coming out stronger. Honestly, I admired that a lot. It was clear they’d been through some serious stuff, and it took a lot of courage to keep going. Even back in high school, we always saw a kind of strength in each other, and tonight that feeling just got bigger.

When the night was ending, I looked at Alex and thought about how much they’d changed. I told them, “You’ve honestly grown into such an amazing person. I’m really glad to have you as my friend.”

Alex smiled, their eyes a little shiny with pride. “You know, Emma, sometimes the really hard stuff makes us the people we’re supposed to be,” they said softly.

As we said goodbye, I couldn’t help but feel like that night changed something for me. It might’ve taken ten years, but it proved that the people who go through the hardest stuff are often the strongest. And I promised myself I’d be there for Alex, supporting them and never forgetting the strength they showed that night.
