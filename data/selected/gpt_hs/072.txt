So, one night I was walking through this kinda shady alley, and out of nowhere, this mugger shows up with a shiny knife. My heart was pounding, but honestly, I didn’t freak out. Instead, I just pulled out a deck of cards from my bag. The guy looked kinda confused, like "What’s this kid gonna do with cards?" Then I started doing some tricks—stuff like making the cards flip and float, trying to catch his attention. 

At first, he looked annoyed, but then he kinda stopped and watched. I guess he was surprised because I just kept going, and suddenly, he put the knife down. I could tell he was kinda mesmerized or maybe just bored with being scary. We ended up just looking at the cards for a while, and honestly, I think he was kinda impressed. In the end, he didn’t bother me anymore, and I dunno, maybe he even felt a little different after that. It was weird but kinda cool to turn a dangerous situation into something totally different with just a simple pack of cards.
