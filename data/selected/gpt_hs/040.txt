Okay, so here’s a more chill, high school style version of that essay. I kept it pretty simple and added some casual touches to make it sound more real.

In the galaxy, there’s this really creepy black market that nobody talks about openly. It all started when some alien species found out that human blood makes them feel really good and high. That one discovery got a lot of them hooked, and soon a whole illegal trade was popping up everywhere. 

Word spread fast, and more and more aliens got involved because they couldn’t get enough of that human blood rush. It wasn’t just a few bad guys either — there were smugglers, middlemen, and dealers working together to keep the whole thing going. Human colonies on different planets started getting attacked a lot more because the aliens were hunting for humans just to get their blood. People started disappearing left and right, which made everyone really scared. Families were losing loved ones, and no one had any real answers. The black market became this secret thing everyone worried about, even on worlds that seemed super peaceful.

There’s this one guy, known only as Vexis, who ran the whole operation from this huge space station miles from where most humans lived. He was the main guy behind all of it, controlling how the blood got shipped and sold. Vexis knew how tempting and dangerous the whole thing was, and he kept control with no mercy. 

Then there’s this girl named Seraphina. Her brother Adrian got caught up in all of it and disappeared. She found out that he was just another victim of the black market, and that made her really angry and sad. She promised herself she’d do something to stop this horrible trade and save others from ending up like her brother. 

Seraphina didn’t do it alone — she joined a group called the Cosmos Resistance. They’re basically rebels fighting to expose and shut down the black market’s terrible operations. As she traveled across different worlds, she found out that some alien species hate what’s happening, too. These good aliens are fighting their own instincts to hunt humans and are trying to help the Resistance end the blood trade. 

Eventually, they found enough proof of what Vexis was doing, and they planned a big attack on his space station. During the raid, Seraphina faced Vexis himself. He tried to hold onto his power by threatening to unleash chaos, trying to make everyone lose control. But the rebels, along with the good aliens, fought back hard — they managed to take Vexis down and shut down the black market’s operation. 

After that, the galaxy started to recover. People learned from what happened, and stricter rules were put in place to prevent this from happening again. The demand for human blood dropped, and everyone agreed to work together to protect innocent lives. Seraphina’s brave actions basically helped save a lot of people and reminded everyone that unity and standing up for what’s right can really make a difference.

In the end, the black market was defeated, and the galaxy moved on from the dark times. Seraphina’s story proved that even in the worst situations, courage and teamwork can overcome evil.
