So, basically, the world got so crowded that there wasn’t enough space or resources for everyone. The government was super desperate and came up with this crazy new law. To get a new birth certificate and have a kid, you had to show proof that someone else had died. Like, you had to prove someone was dead so you could be born or get a new ID or whatever.

People freaked out when they heard about this. I mean, how can you even measure life in a game where someone's death has to happen first? It’s pretty messed up. Some folks thought it was totally wrong, like it was making human lives into something you could buy or trade. But the government said they had no choice, because the Earth was basically about to give out. So, yeah, they did something really extreme—maybe crazy, but they thought it was necessary.

Everyone had to decide if they wanted to live at any cost or if they were okay with others having to die for it. Some people tried to cheat the system—faking death reports or hacking stuff to get around the law. But the government had all these high-tech tools to catch the cheaters, so it wasn’t easy.

Most people, though, just accepted it somehow—they saw it as their only shot at living longer. People started trading death certificates, trying to find ways to ‘buy’ a new start. Families sometimes had to make really tough choices, even turning on each other, like siblings giving up each other’s lives so they could survive. Friends betrayed friends, too, giving up lives for a chance to go on.

But, even in all this dark stuff, there were some good things happening. Some groups popped up that tried to make things better—they promoted the idea that maybe people could volunteer to give up their lives, willingly, for someone they loved or for future generations. That spark of kindness and humanity gave people some hope, even in the middle of all the chaos.

As this law kept changing society, people started thinking differently about life and death. They began to really appreciate each moment because they knew life wasn’t endless anymore. The idea of leaving a legacy became more about what you did for the whole human race, not just yourself. Everyone was trying to make sure humanity kept going, even if it meant some sacrifices.

Over time, society found a kind of balance, but it was delicate. People understood what it meant to give up your life now so someone else could have a future. The law left a big mark on everyone’s hearts, made them remember how precious life is—and how important it is to look out for each other.

In the end, mankind had to adapt to this new way of life, where death was almost like a currency. They never forgot the lives they had to trade or sacrifice. But through all this, they also learned about the importance of compassion, sacrifice, and understanding. Weird as it was, maybe it made them realize what really matters most.
