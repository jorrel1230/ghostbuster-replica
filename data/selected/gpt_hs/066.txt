It was just an ordinary Tuesday afternoon when everything changed. One second, the busy streets were full of people walking around, talking, laughing. The next, everything went completely silent. I looked around, super confused, trying to figure out what was happening. It was like the whole world just disappeared. For a second, I thought maybe I was dreaming or maybe I was just going crazy.

But then I started thinking maybe… just maybe… they’re all throwing a surprise party for me! That thought made me smile a little. I started walking through the empty streets, looking inside shops and houses, thinking I’d see everyone jumping out and shouting "surprise!" like in the movies. But no, everything was still dead silent, and every house and door was shut tight.

Days went by, then weeks. No one came back, and the quiet just got creepier. I wandered around in confusion, feeling pretty hopeless. Sometimes, my mind started imagining the worst—like maybe some big tragedy happened, or maybe everyone just left for weird reasons. But I refused to completely give up hope. A little part of me still believed that the surprise party was out there somewhere, waiting for me.

Months later, it got even harder to believe that anyone was coming back. The loneliness started to really get to me. Doubts crept in, making me wonder if I was crazy or if something terrible had happened. But even through all the sadness, I kept this tiny ember of hope alive — the hope that maybe, somehow, I was right and they were planning something for me.

Then, after two whole years, I finally found out the truth. A radio crackled on, and the news was terrible—something had gone wrong with an experiment, and I had been caught in it. Everyone else was gone because of a mistake I had no control over. It was more like some kind of accident than a big secret or a plan. Honestly, it crushed me. I cried because I realized the "surprise party" was just my imagination all along.

Even though I was super sad, I held onto that memory of being hopeful, of thinking everything was okay. That part of me, the part that wanted to believe in something good, still stayed alive. Even all alone, I learned that you have to be strong and keep going, no matter how tough things get. Sometimes, hope is the only thing you’ve got.
