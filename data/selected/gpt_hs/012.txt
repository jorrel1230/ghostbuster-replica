Okay, so imagine a world kinda like ours but with this weird rule: everyone has to laugh at least once every day. If they don’t, then at midnight, death comes for them. Seriously, if you skip your laugh, you’re toast.

In this crazy world, people are obsessed with humor. Mornings start with funny shows or radio stuff, trying to make everyone smile. Comedy clubs are everywhere, and they’re always packed because everyone loves to laugh. The biggest awards go to the funniest people, since their job is basically to keep everyone alive and happy, just by making them laugh.

There’s this girl named Lily. She’s super cheerful and always trying to find ways to make people laugh. From sunrise to sunset, she’s joking around, telling puns and silly stories. Her laughs are contagious, and everyone around her ends up cracking a smile or even laughing out loud. She really loves making others happy.

But over time, things started to change. People got kind of tired and scared. The thought that if you don’t laugh by midnight, you’ll die, isn’t as funny anymore. It’s more like a duty now, not something they genuinely enjoy. Instead of real laughs, they just do polite chuckles or fake smiles. The humor that used to fill this place with joy started to feel empty, like a game they had to play.

Lily refused to give up, though. She wanted to bring back the real happiness and remind everyone what laughter was really about. So she traveled around, doing her best to spread genuine jokes and fun. She went to busy markets and whispered funny stories that made strangers burst out laughing. She even went to serious events, turning their sadness into happiness with a joke here and there. Slowly, people started smiling again, really smiling, not just pretending.

Laughter started to feel natural again. People cracked jokes and actually laughed louder and more genuinely. The funny people of the world got better reactions, and everyone felt more alive. The fear of midnight still hung over them, but it was less scary now. Instead of an ending, midnight became more like a reminder to enjoy each day while it lasts.

The clock still ticked towards midnight, but now it wasn’t about being afraid of dying. It was about appreciating every moment and finding joy. People learned to not take laughter for granted. It became something valuable, like a symbol of life itself, proof that humor can really keep us going.

When midnight finally struck, everyone gathered together, sharing in the laughter and smiles. The streets lit up with joy, and people just laughed together as the clock hit twelve. It wasn’t a day of fear anymore—it was a celebration of life and happiness. They understood that laughing isn’t just a funny thing to do; it’s what makes life worth living.

So in this strange world, the idea of death turned into a reason to really appreciate being alive. And in the end, everyone learned that the most important thing is to enjoy each moment—they found that laughter isn’t just about jokes, it’s about holding onto happiness and living fully.
