Once there was a guy named Thomas who lived in this tiny village deep in the woods, and honestly, he was pretty weird because he had no shadow and no reflection. Like, ever since he was a kid, people stared at him weird and treated him kind of like a freak. They were scared of him because he was so different, which made Thomas feel really lonely sometimes.

He got used to not having shadows or reflections, and he kind of accepted that he was different. But honestly, he always wondered why he was like that and wanted to know if he could find out the reason behind it. It made him curious, and he didn’t want to accept just the fact that he was different without knowing why.

One day, someone told him about this old sorcerer who supposedly lived on a mountain far away. The stories said he knew everything and might have the answers Thomas was looking for. So, Thomas decided to go on this really tough journey to find him. It wasn’t easy — he had to walk through forests, over mountains, and face all kinds of tough stuff — but eventually, he made it.

When he finally reached the sorcerer’s house, the old guy looked at Thomas with kind of an understanding look. He told him that centuries ago, one of Thomas’ ancestors had made a deal with a tricky spirit to get eternal life, but in return, they lost their shadow and reflection. It was some kinda curse or deal that passed down through the family.

Hearing this, Thomas felt surprised but also somehow free. He realized that maybe not having a shadow or reflection wasn’t just a curse — it was a special thing that made him unique. Instead of feeling sad about it, he started to see it as a gift. People were actually kind of curious about him and thought he had a kind of special energy about him.

Thomas then decided to do good with his weirdness. He wanted to be someone others could look up to — a kind of symbol of how being different isn’t bad. He used his mystery and strange aura to bring happiness and kindness wherever he went.

In the end, Thomas learned that what really matters isn’t whether you have a shadow or reflection, but the kindness and light you share with others. That’s what makes a person special.
