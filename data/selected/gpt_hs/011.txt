It was kind of a creepy night when I was standing outside this really big, scary-looking mental hospital. It was 10 PM, and I felt shivery even though I was holding a warm pizza box that I was supposed to deliver to the lockdown ward. There was like this thick fog everywhere, which made everything feel even freakier.

As I walked down the dim hallways inside, I started to feel a little nervous. The walls had old posters that looked like they’d been through a lot, and the smell in the air was weird—kind of like a mix of cleaning stuff and sadness. My footsteps echoed in the silence, making everything sound kind of spooky.

Finally, I got to a heavy metal door with a small window. Through the glass, I saw a dimly lit room filled with patients. Their eyes looked empty, and they were dressed in straightjackets and chains. I couldn’t imagine what kind of pain or suffering led them here, away from everything outside.

My heart was pounding as I knocked on the door. After a few moments, it swung open, and there was an orderly standing there. He looked really disheveled and serious. His eyes widened when he saw me holding the pizza, like he was confused or surprised.

I gave him the pizza, my hands shaking a little. But then, instead of taking it, he suddenly grabbed my wrist really tight. His grip was like steel, and he looked angry.

"Nice try, get back to your room," he growled, his voice kinda threatening. I was totally confused. I tried to tell him I wasn’t a patient, I was just delivering pizza, but he didn’t seem to hear me. Before I knew it, he was pulling me inside the room and slamming the door shut behind us.

That’s when I started to feel scared. It hit me hard, like cold steel blades going through my mind. I kept trying to explain that I didn’t belong there, but he wasn’t listening. Inside, the patients looked at me with a weird mix of curiosity and apathy. Their eyes seemed to hold memories of other lives, long gone, lost in the darkness and confusion.

The clock kept ticking, and I started to realize I was basically stuck there, like a prisoner in some nightmare world where “normal” was super rare. Days felt like weeks, and the only thing keeping me sane was thinking about the outside world—what it used to be like before I got caught up in all of this. The grip on my wrist never loosened, always reminding me I was trapped.

But even in that dark place, I somehow found a little hope. It was fragile and barely visible, but it was there. That hope was the strength of the human spirit—the will to survive no matter what. 

One night, the orderly fell asleep in a corner, snoring loudly. I took a deep breath, trying to stay calm, and then carefully reached into his pocket hoping to find some keys. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might jump out of my chest. But I managed to grab them just before he woke up. 

With trembling hands, I unlocked the door, which had kept me locked in for way too long. Slowly, I tiptoed past the patients, trying not to wake the guy sleeping in the corner. When I finally stood in the hallway, I felt like I might faint from all the relief. I knew I had to get out fast.

I ran towards the door, adrenaline rushing through me, and pushed it open. Outside, I could breathe easier—there were stars in the sky, and I could hear city sounds far away. As I stepped into the night, I realized that the strength to face anything is inside us, in our mind.

After that, I decided I couldn’t just ignore what was going on inside those walls. I wanted to do something to help the people stuck in there. I became someone who spoke for those who couldn’t, trying to bring light to a really dark place. 

Even though I’ll never forget those crazy days, I know I can make a difference. Hope always finds a way to grow, even in the darkest times.
