Okay, so here’s my version, kind of simple and natural as a high school student:

Humans have this crazy thing where, if they’re in serious danger, they can basically turn into their best-ever self. Like super strong, fast, smart, you name it. This thing is called going Prime, and it’s been happening for over three years now.

At first, everyone was pretty shocked by it. People started rushing around faster, fighting harder, and just being way more capable than before. It was like everyone suddenly had a secret power. Because of that, people could handle all kinds of dangerous situations and survive even the worst stuff. There were lots of moments where people put themselves on the line to save others, and it kind of felt like everyone was a hero.

But after a while, the newness started to wear off. It wasn’t as exciting because everyone kind of got used to always being ready to go Prime. It became normal to live in this constant state of alert. The world started to feel more like a dangerous place all the time, because you never really knew when you’d have to transform again. Schools changed too—they became like training facilities so kids could learn to use their powers. Even businesses had to adapt, making plans to make the most of people’s Prime abilities whenever they needed to. Relationships got complicated too — no one wanted to be vulnerable anymore, since everyone expected people to always be at their best.

Even with all this power, people started feeling tired and just wanted some peace. Everyone wanted a world where you didn’t have to constantly be ready to fight or transform. So, a lot of us started hoping we could go back to normal someday.

Scientists and researchers spent tons of time trying to figure out where this Prime thing even came from. Slowly, they got a better idea of what caused it and how it worked. That gave people hope—maybe there was a way to stop it or control it better.

Through all that work, one thing was clear: going Prime had changed humanity forever. It made us stronger and smarter, and we weren’t just gonna give up. Instead, we kept fighting to find a way to fix everything and bring back a world where danger doesn’t control our lives.

Hope this feels more casual and natural, like how a high school student might write.
