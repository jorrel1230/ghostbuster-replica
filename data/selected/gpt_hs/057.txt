So, I was in the elevator, just riding down alone, and there was this vacuum cleaner sitting in the corner. Honestly, it was kind of creepy, like no one was there with me. Then, out of nowhere, I swear I felt kind of weird, like everything around me was about to change. Suddenly, the vacuum turned on by itself, and it started making all these loud noises. But then, the walls of the elevator seemed to melt away, and I saw stars and space stuff everywhere. I swear I saw weird glowing creatures dancing around. It was so weird but kind of cool too, like I was in some kind of sci-fi movie. For a second, I thought maybe I was dreaming or losing my mind. Then, just like that, the elevator went back to normal, all clean and quiet like nothing had happened. It was super strange, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I’d just had a crazy experience I’d never forget.
