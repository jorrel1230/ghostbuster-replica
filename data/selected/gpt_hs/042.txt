Okay, so here’s a rewritten version in a more casual, high school student style:

---

Death is this supernatural being who kind of… wanders around forever. But he’s got this weird curse—he can only see one person at a time, and he always knows he has to kill that person. No matter who they are—young, old, good, bad—it doesn’t matter. When Death looks at someone, that’s who it’s gonna be.

He's been doing this for what feels like forever, always carrying out his job without stopping. He doesn’t care if the person is a saint or a sinner, he just has one job and he does it. One day, he’s just floating over a busy city, and his eyes land on this girl named Isabel. She looks pretty innocent, with a kind of light about her. That’s the only person he can see, and he’s stuck watching her life, from when she’s a baby until… well, until she dies.

Over time, Death kinda starts seeing the beauty in all this. It’s weird because he’s supposed to be this death figure, but he starts feeling stuff—kind of like sadness when he takes someone’s life. He begins to realize that maybe his curse isn’t just about killing but about witnessing life too. He’s seen so much and felt so much just by watching.

So, after a while, he makes a choice. Instead of just following his old job and only choosing someone to kill, he gives up that power. He stops being this cold reaper and becomes like a quiet protector or guide for the souls that leave this world. Now, he’s not just about death—he’s about helping people find peace when they go.

And honestly, by doing this, Death learns way more about what life really is. He’s no longer just the end; he’s kind of part of the whole story. Every time he helps someone move on, he feels a little grateful that maybe his curse let him understand what it all means—life, death, and everything in between.
