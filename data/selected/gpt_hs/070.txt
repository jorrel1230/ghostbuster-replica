So, I don’t really remember it, but before I was born, apparently I went through some kind of weird character creation thing, like in a game or an RPG. I had to choose my traits, skills, virtues, all that stuff. Then I died and sort of realized I’d made a bunch of wrong choices from the very beginning.

When I died, I was standing in front of this glowing council, and they were kinda whispering to me, telling me that before I was born I had set all these things about myself. I couldn’t remember any of it, which made it even more confusing. They told me I’d picked my attributes and traits and all that. And suddenly, it clicked. All the stuff I’d chosen—I didn’t use it right. 

It hit me hard that I’d messed up. I had courage, but I never really took chances or faced my fears. I was kind and caring at heart, but I let people who needed help go by. I had a sharp mind and quick wit, but I used it to hurt others instead of helping or making things better. I picked talkative and persuasive traits, but only so I could manipulate people for my own benefit. 

It was pretty heartbreaking to realize the potential I’d wasted. All the good things I could have done, I just threw away. I saw how my choices affected the people around me—my family, my friends. I was selfish, dishonest, and I refused to admit I had flaws. 

As I watched my life flash before my eyes, I begged for another shot, asking for forgiveness. I promised I’d do better if I got the chance. The council kind of gave me a slim hope—like, a tiny chance to come back. They told me I’d remember everything this time, and I could actually use my powers to create a better life, one that matters. 

So, with a little hope and a lot of nervousness, I took a deep breath and decided to go back into the world. I wanted to fix my mistakes, hold onto the good virtues I’d been given, and try to actually make something meaningful out of my life this time.
