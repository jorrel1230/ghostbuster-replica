After so many years with no signs of life from space, NASA finally caught a strange radio signal. And get this – it only said seven words: "The birds are not what they seem." Everyone was freaking out. People at NASA were trying to figure out what it meant. Was it a warning? Or maybe they were asking for help? Whatever it was, it made everyone on Earth nervous. 

Soon after, things with birds started to get weird. They started flying in huge groups, but their eyes didn’t look innocent anymore. Their songs, which used to sound nice, started to feel really creepy. It was like they weren’t really birds at all, but something else. The sky started to feel like a nightmare, with all the strange bird behavior. It was like we were just part of some huge cosmic game, and honestly, it freaked everyone out.
