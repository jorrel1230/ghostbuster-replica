There’s this immortal guy who’s been wishing forever to finally die so he can be with Death, who he loves. For hundreds of years, he kept begging the universe to make him mortal, so he could finally be with her again. He kept trying stuff to see if maybe he could die, but no matter what he did, life just wouldn’t let go of him. He went to dangerous places, talked to wise people, even met with old spirits, hoping someone could help him. But every time he tried, he just realized how unlucky he was—his curse kept him alive no matter what. Still, he kept going, holding onto the hope that someday he’d be with Death. And then, one day, he saw that maybe what he was actually craving wasn’t just dying, but really appreciating the time he already had with her, even if they were apart. It kinda made him see that maybe being with her forever wasn’t so bad after all.
