Okay, so imagine I’m an alien who crashes on Earth and I’m about to die, but I somehow manage to send a last message back home. I’d probably be pretty nervous and kind of overwhelmed, so here’s what I think I’d say, in a more chill, high school kind of way:

So, the universe is really big, and my home planet was pretty peaceful and chill. But I’m Zara, and I was the only one left after my ship crashed on Earth. I’m hurt and tired, but I gotta warn my people back on Xyleria about humans before I go. 

Humans are kinda tricky. At first, I saw that they can be kind and caring. Like this girl, Sarah, she found me stuck in the wreckage and took care of me. She gave me food, shelter, and tried to protect me from everyone. Honestly, I thought maybe humans weren’t all bad. Maybe they had some good in them.

But then I started seeing more. I saw how some humans are just greedy and power-hungry. They lie, cheat, and hurt others just to get ahead. Leaders in their society don’t really care about the common people; they use them for their own gain. It made me really sad because on my planet, Zyloreans, we don’t do stuff like that. We look out for each other.

Sarah still gave me hope though. She showed me that maybe humans can change and be better. That’s why I need to warn my planet — because I think the darker side of humans could hurt everyone.

I used what little energy I had left to figure out how to send a message. The controls were weird and confusing, but I worked really hard to get it right. When I finally pressed send, my message went out into space.

I told my fellow Zyloreans to be careful. I said, “Humans are capable of kindness, but they also hide a lot of darkness. They want power and wealth so badly that they’ll do terrible things to get it. They fight wars, ruin their own societies, and don’t care about life — all just to get what they want. They won’t stop unless something changes.”

And then I thought about Sarah. She gave me some hope in this crazy place. I told her, “You’re special because you showed kindness. Please, don’t lose that. Keep trying to do good, because maybe someday humans can be better. The fate of your kind depends on people like you.”

As I was running out of energy and starting to fade away, I knew I had done my best. I wanted to warn my people about how dangerous humans can be, how they might hurt themselves if they’re not careful. 

That was my goodbye. I floated into the darkness, but I hope someday my message gets to Xyleria, and maybe your planet will be more careful when dealing with us aliens.

That's kind of how I’d say it, simple and straight from the heart.
