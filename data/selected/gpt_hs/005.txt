There’s this old funeral home in the middle of the city, and it kinda feels really quiet and sad sometimes. The guy running it is Mortimer Stone. He’s just a regular mortician, but somehow he’s got this weird power. He can fix not only dead bodies but also their souls, like bringing them back to life. But here’s the catch — every time he does that, he loses a year of his own life. So he’s kinda stuck walking the line between being alive and dead himself.

For a long time, Mortimer used his power to help families say goodbye and find closure. He’d turn tears into smiles and grief into peace. But over the years, it started to wear on him. His face got really lined, and his eyes, which used to look full of energy, seemed a little haunted. You could tell he was tired.

Then one night, something terrible happened. There was this really bad accident in the city that took a bunch of lives — like dozens. Among them was Margaret, a young woman with a super bright spirit. Her family was totally devastated and asked Mortimer if he could try to bring her back. They really wanted to see her alive once more.

Mortimer hesitated but finally agreed. He took a deep breath and went into his little chapel, knowing what he was about to do would cost him. The room was dim, and the only light flickered a little, casting creepy shadows. He closed his eyes and recited some old words his family had passed down over generations. Then he gently placed his hands on Margaret’s chest.

Suddenly, there was a bright flash of light, and Mortimer felt like his energy was majorly draining out of him. Margaret’s body started to glow softly, her face coming back to life, and finally, her eyes blinked open. She was alive again, and Mortimer knew his power had worked.

Over the next few days, Margaret got stronger and healthier. But Mortimer started to look really worn out. His body was getting weaker, his steps unsteady. It was clear every time he used his gift, he paid a price — a little part of himself faded away. Still, he smiled whenever he saw Margaret alive and happy, feeling like he’d done something good.

Years passed, and Mortimer changed a lot. He looked older — his face was full of wrinkles, and his hair was gray now. He was pretty much exhausted all the time, but he kept going because he saw Margaret thriving and living her best life. She became an artist and found happiness, and she always remembered Mortimer as the guy who gave her that second chance.

One cold winter night, Mortimer’s body finally couldn’t take it anymore. His heart started to slow, and he knew it was his last night. He called Margaret over, and she sat beside him, holding his fragile hand with tears in her eyes. She was super sad but also thankful.

“Margaret,” he whispered weakly, almost a breath, “I’m… grateful.” 

She leaned in, tears falling down her cheeks. “Yes, Mortimer?”

He managed a shaky smile. “For… the chance… to see you flourish.”

Her tears turned to full-on sobs, and she held his hand tight. “You gave me a life worth living, Mortimer. I’ll never forget you. You showed me what love and hope really are.”

His eyes flickered one last time, and he softly said, “And you… showed me… what harm I can do… and the good I can still do.” With those words, Mortimer took his final breath. His soul was finally free from his tired body.

Even after he was gone, Margaret kept his memory alive. She honored what he did for her and others, and the funeral home became a symbol of hope during dark times. Somewhere beyond this world, Mortimer was watching over everyone he helped. His sacrifice had been tough, but in a weird way, it made his life meaningful.

In the end, Mortimer’s life wasn’t easy — it cost him everything. But through that, he found something special: purpose, love, and the knowledge that he really made a difference.
