So, honestly, I never really believed in Hell. I always thought it was more like, instead of Hell, when you die, you go to Purgatory to figure out your stuff. And only the ones who have learned their lesson get to go to Heaven. Well, I’m that soul. The one who survived what’s probably the longest punishment anyone has ever had.

It all started when I was born. Just like everyone else, I guess. I made mistakes, bad choices, stuff I shouldn’t have done. Over time, those sins piled up, like a huge waterfall crashing down on me. Before I knew it, I was stuck in this place called Purgatory. They say it’s where souls go to make things right, but honestly, time here doesn’t work like it does on Earth. It’s always a kinda dim, twilight kind of zone — no bright days or dark nights, just endless grey.

We’re chained up in this dark, kinda creepy dungeon of guilt. All of us, carrying the weight of what we did wrong. The regrets just kept hitting us, echoing in the silence. I went through things I honestly don’t even want to remember — never-ending pain from what I’d done.

Weeks, months, maybe even centuries went by. While most souls got 'cleansed' and moved on, I stayed. I was like a living proof of how badly I had screwed up. The darkness was always there, whispering all the things I wished I could change from my past.

But over time, something started to change inside me. Those flames of regret turned into this intense, burning fire of determination. I got tired of being lost in the shadows. So I fought — I pushed myself to get out of that pit, driven by this crazy hope for redemption.

Time kind of lost all meaning, but I kept fighting. My sins, which once felt like chains, started to become stepping stones. I began to face each mistake head-on, trying to ask for forgiveness from the people I had hurt (even if they weren’t there anymore). It wasn’t easy — it felt like every step forward was a huge struggle, but I kept going.

And as I fought through all that pain, I started to grow. I learned that I could find love and compassion inside me, even after all the wrong I’d done. It was like I was becoming someone new, someone better.

Then, one day, it happened. The eternal twilight started to brighten, turning into shades of gold and blue. A bright figure, like an angel, appeared. They said they were sent from Heaven to see how I’d changed. They told me I’d earned my way out — that I was finally ready to go to Heaven.

When I finally stepped through those gates, I felt honestly overwhelmed. All the guilt and punishment lifted off my shoulders, replaced with peace and all the lessons I’d learned from my journey. I was no longer just the person who made mistakes. I was someone who had fought to become better.

Now, living in Heaven, I tell my story to remind others that redemption is possible. I walk among angels and share hope with anyone who listens. I see it in their eyes — a spark that maybe, just maybe, they can find their way too.

So yeah, I’m that soul. The one who endured the longest sentence, but who made it through the darkness to find the light. And honestly, I wouldn’t change anything about my journey — it turned me into who I am today.
