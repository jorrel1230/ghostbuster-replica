The rain battered mercilessly outside, cloaking the city in a shroud of somber gloom. I sat in the dimly lit room, staring at my latest mark—a man known in the underground as ‘The Whisper.’ He owed a hefty debt to the boss, and it was my task to make him pay, one way or another. As ‘The Interrogator,’ I was famed for my knack for breaking anyone, making them reveal their deepest secrets. But today, there was an added pressure pressing down on me.

In this bleak world, lifespan was measured by a word count. Every person was born with a finite number of words; once they ran out, death followed. I, however, was granted millions of extra words—a privilege granted by the boss, probably to boost my efficiency. But now, that bonus felt like a curse, because my mark only had one word left before it was all over.

The Whisper sat across from me, drenched in sweat, trembling—fear thick in the air. His eyes flicked nervously, searching for an escape that didn’t exist. His reputation as a cold, ruthless man earned him his nickname, ‘The Whisper,’ in the first place. Ironically, now he was left with only a single word, ready to be spoken before his time ran out.

I lit a cigarette, watching the smoke curl and twist, filling the tense silence. I knew the small talk was long gone; I needed to break him—in one shot. I leaned in, voice a low murmur, “One word left, Whisper. Just one. Make it count, my friend.”

His eyes shimmered with a mix of desperation and acceptance. I’d seen that look before, but never under this kind of pressure. He looked at me, carrying the weight of a lifetime on his lips. At last, in a barely audible whisper, he said his final word: “Why?”

Silence fell again, heavy and deep, echoing in my mind. ‘Why?’—it was a question that stirred my curiosity, even with death looming. Maybe there was a way to save him, to find a loophole in this cruel game we all played.

I reached into my coat and pulled out a worn, battered notebook—pages upon pages of words, my secret weapon, my hidden treasure. While others had to guard their words carefully, I could write as much as I pleased, each one a potential lifesaver for someone teetering on the edge.

Flipping through the pages, I searched for the perfect word—one that could turn the tide and keep him alive. Then, like a soft whisper carried on the breeze, I found it. “Silence.” I quickly scribbled it on a piece of paper, trembling as I slid it across the table toward him.

His eyes widened with hope, a flicker like a candle in the dark. A single tear tracked down his cheek as he read the word. But before he could question its meaning, I raised my hand to silence him. My voice, usually firm and commanding, now faltered: “Write this down, Whisper. It will grant you silence—in every sense. No more talking, no more words spent. An eternal silence that will save your life.”

He took the paper, studying it carefully, contemplating its meaning. Finally, he nodded, gratitude shining in his eyes. With that, he took a deep breath, bracing himself to accept a lifetime of unspoken words.

As the door creaked shut behind me, I couldn’t help but wonder—what would become of the Whisper? Would this silence bring him peace, or torture him endlessly? Had I truly saved his life, or merely delayed his suffering? The relentless rain kept falling, washing away the remnants of our confrontation—only the echoes of my doubts remaining in its wake.

One thing was certain: though I had shielded him from death, the burden of his silence would linger on my conscience. That was the price I paid in this life—an existence where words have weight, and silence can be a heavy burden, an unspoken truth that persists beyond death.
