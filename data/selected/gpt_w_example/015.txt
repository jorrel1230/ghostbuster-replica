In a world where peril was a constant presence, humans possessed a remarkable trait that distinguished them: the ability to transform into their peak physical form and unleash heightened intelligence when their lives were at risk. This extraordinary capability, often referred to as going Prime, had become an inherent part of life on Earth for over three years now. 

Initially, this transformation astonished everyone. People became faster, stronger, and more agile than ever before. Enhanced with sharper minds, humans could confront any danger that threatened their survival. The world saw feats of heroism and resilience as individuals rose to meet the challenge head-on.

Over time, however, the excitement began to fade. People grew accustomed to the constant state of alertness, expecting to be in their prime at all times. The environment transformed into a relentless battleground where every moment carried the risk of death. Society itself changed dramatically: schools turned into training facilities for mastering these new powers, and businesses developed strategies to capitalize on employees’ prime potential. Relationships grew more complex, as vulnerability and mediocrity no longer found a place in this new world order.

Yet amid this chaos, a sense of unity emerged. Recognizing their shared vulnerability, humans banded together to protect one another. Communities thrived on the collective experience of going Prime, forming a global network focused on survival. Despite the overwhelming power and intelligence now available, humanity still craved normalcy—a life without the constant need to transform. They embarked on a shared mission to restore stability and peace.

Scientists and researchers dedicated endless hours to uncovering the origins of this extraordinary ability. Gradually, they began to understand the mechanisms that triggered the prime transformation. Hope sparked within their hearts as the possibility of finding a solution grew more tangible.

Throughout their tireless efforts, they never lost sight of the inner strength each person carried. Going Prime had shaped a new kind of human—one resilient and resourceful, refusing to surrender to the threats around them. United by their resilience and intelligence, they knew they could find a way to reclaim the world—the world where danger no longer dictated their lives.
