I woke up suddenly, a surge of adrenaline coursing through my body, and there standing at the foot of my bed was the devil. His eyes, fierce and crimson, locked onto mine, leaving me momentarily paralyzed—unable to speak or move. It felt as if time had frozen in that terrifying instant.

Then, with an unsettling tap, the devil broke the silence. His crooked smile stretched wider as he whispered, "You're it," before dissolving into a wisp of smoke. Left alone, I was overwhelmed, my mind struggling to grasp the surreal encounter I had just experienced.

Days stretched on, yet his words lingered in my mind: "You're it?" What could he have meant? I dedicated myself to finding answers, devouring books and diving into folklore and religious texts to better understand what had happened. Every effort brought me a step closer to understanding this mysterious visit.

It gradually became clear that I had been chosen—the devil's words signified a significant role I was destined to play. I had been given a rare and powerful responsibility: to combat evil and restore balance in a world teetering on chaos. My purpose was to stand against the darkness that threatened human existence.

Initially, fear held me back, but resolve soon replaced doubt. The devil’s visit served as a catalyst for change. I trained my mind and body, developing the strength necessary to face the evil forces lurking in shadows. Embracing this newfound calling, I prepared myself for the arduous fight ahead.

Years of relentless effort followed, as I balanced between humankind and the supernatural realm. Every battle was tough, yet I refused to surrender. When hope waned, I remembered those piercing, blood-red eyes, which fueled my resolve and ignited an inner fire to continue fighting.

Today, I stand stronger than ever, shaped by countless challenges. As a defender against evil, I strive to bring peace and protect those who cannot protect themselves. I have become a symbol of hope amidst darkness.

And although the devil chose me that morning, I made my own choice—to make a difference. From that moment of despair, I emerged as something more powerful than I had ever imagined: a force that even the devil himself could not predict, one destined to prevail.
