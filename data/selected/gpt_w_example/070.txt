As the veil between life and death lifted, I found myself standing before an ethereal council. They spoke in hushed whispers, reminding me that, prior to my birth, I had undergone a character creation process. I was stunned, for I could not remember any of it. They explained that I had determined my attributes, virtues, traits, and natural skills. Suddenly, everything became clear.

I had been a fool, choosing the wrong paths from the very beginning. In life, I was endowed with courage, yet I often avoided opportunities that demanded bravery. Kindness flowed naturally within me, yet I frequently turned a blind eye to those in need. I possessed a sharp wit, but I used it to hurt rather than to heal. I had selected skills like eloquence and persuasion, but only to manipulate others for personal advantage.

It was heartbreaking to realize how much potential I had wasted, how my purpose had been squandered. Regret overwhelmed my spirit as I saw how my choices affected those around me. My loved ones endured the consequences of my selfishness, my lack of integrity, and my refusal to face my own flaws.

As my life flashed before my eyes, I begged for forgiveness, promising to do better if given another chance. The council granted me a glimmer of redemption, offering me the opportunity to return to the mortal realm. They assured me that this time I would remember the character creation process, enabling me to unlock my true potential and create a life filled with meaning and purpose.

With renewed resolve, I took a deep breath and re-entered the world, ready to make amends, to embrace the virtues I was given, and to shape my destiny with the wisdom I had gained from my past mistakes.
