Once upon a time, in a small village called Willowbrook, there was a mischievous child named Lucy. She was lively and clever, but whenever it came to homework, she always looked for excuses to avoid it. One day, as her incomplete math assignment stared at her from the desk, Lucy found an old book hidden deep inside the village library.

Her curiosity was piqued, and she started flipping through its pages until she spotted a spell. The spell claimed to summon a demon who could do her homework for her—a tempting idea. Laughing at how impossible it sounded, Lucy whispered the words aloud, not knowing what might happen.

To her surprise, smoke began swirling around her room, and standing right in front of her was a towering demon named Zephron. With glowing red eyes and sharp claws, he looked quite intimidating. Lucy’s heart pounded as she explained her problem and pleaded for help. Surprisingly, the demon listened and agreed to assist her—but only under one condition.

Zephron wanted one month of freedom in exchange for his help. After that, he promised he would come back for one day to take something valuable from her. Feeling desperate, Lucy agreed without hesitation, focusing only on getting her homework done.

Over the next few weeks, Zephron worked tirelessly, completing Lucy’s assignments and helping her improve her grades. Despite his fierce appearance, she soon discovered he possessed a kind side. They talked, shared stories, and even laughed together, getting to know each other while tackling every task.

When the month was up, Zephron reminded Lucy of their deal. With tears in her eyes, she handed him her favorite silver locket—an heirloom from her late grandmother. Zephron’s eyes softened, and he promised to keep it safe.

Years went by, and Lucy achieved great success as she continued her education. On the night before her high school graduation, Zephron appeared once more. This time, he returned her locket, now transformed into a beautiful necklace that symbolized their unique friendship.

Lucy always remembered the demon who gently guided her and became her friend. Through their unusual bond, she learned that sometimes, even the darkest creatures can have the kindest hearts. Inspired by her experience, she dedicated her life to helping others discover their own hidden potential—just as she had discovered hers, with the help of an unlikely demon friend.
