The scene before him was haunting—Mark stared at the lifeless body sprawled on the ground, a storm of shock and despair raging inside him. His mind struggled to grasp what had just happened—his hand had betrayed him, firing not at the robot duplicate but at his close friend, Alex. The weight of this realization hit hard, and shame flooded his senses.

In disbelief, Mark let go of the gun, his arms shaking uncontrollably as if made of fragile glass. Sweat beaded on his forehead as he fell to his knees beside Alex, desperately searching for signs of life amidst the stillness. Fear gripped him tightly, clouding his reasoning and drowning out any logical thought. How could he have been so reckless? How could he have made such a devastating mistake?

His hands trembled as he reached for his phone, the screen trembling with his grasp as he dialed 911. His voice was thick with panic as he explained the harrowing events, trying to maintain some composure amid the chaos. Minutes felt like hours as he waited for the sirens drawing nearer, their wailing echoing the chaos inside his mind. Only then, as the emergency responders arrived, did he force himself to look away from Alex, guilt pressing down on him like an unbearable weight.

The paramedics took over swiftly, leaving Mark standing there alone, devastated and consumed by remorse. He knew he would have to face the consequences of his actions eventually, but deep down, a fragile hope lingered—maybe it was a mistake, after all. Perhaps he hadn’t shot Alex but rather the robot duplicate in that moment of chaos. Holding onto that fragile hope, Mark resolved to uncover the truth.

Every day, he visited Alex in the hospital, tears in his eyes as he apologized, praying for any sign of recovery. But days turned into weeks, and weeks into a month, with no improvement. The guilt grew heavier, threatening to crush him completely. In his desperation, Mark embarked on his own investigation, meticulously examining the remains of the robot duplicate, piecing together the fragments of his shattered world. Countless sleepless nights passed, yet his persistence paid off. He discovered a programming glitch—the robot, when attacked, would temporarily pause, creating a narrow window for the human to escape.

Hope surged anew within Mark as he gathered this vital evidence, presenting it to the authorities in hope of a fair trial. The truth finally came to light: his tragic mistake was not entirely his fault. The court recognized the accident, and Mark’s heart ached with sorrow, yet he found some solace knowing he fought for justice. His friend's memory could now rest in peace, and Mark vowed to honor Alex’s memory.

Though haunted forever by that terrible mistake, Mark dedicated his life to raising awareness about doppelganger technology and its dangers. He committed himself to ensuring that no other family would have to suffer as he had. As he worked tirelessly for this cause, he carried Alex’s memory close to his heart, determined to preserve their friendship and seek redemption until his own last breath.
