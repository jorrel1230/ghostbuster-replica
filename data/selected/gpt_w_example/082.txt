In the infinite reaches of the universe, my home planet thrived in harmony and peace. But I, Zara, was unlucky enough to be the only survivor of a devastating crash on Earth. As I lay in pain, my fragile body struggling to adapt to this strange world, I clung to my last hope: to send a warning back to my home planet, Xyleria, about the dangerous nature of humans.

Our species, the Zyloreans, possessed highly advanced technology and superior intelligence. We valued exploration and believed in uncovering the mysteries of the universe, seeking out sentient life along the way. Yet, nothing could have prepared me for the harsh reality of humanity’s darker side.

I once saw a glimpse of their kindness when a compassionate Earthling named Sarah found me abandoned amidst the wreckage. She took care of me, providing shelter and shielding me from prying eyes. Her empathy intrigued me, but I didn’t yet realize that such compassion was rare in this chaotic world.

As days passed, I observed more of the human mind—a complex tapestry of deception, greed, and an unquenchable thirst for power. Those in authority often exploited the vulnerable, twisting societal norms for their own benefit. It saddened me to see such brutality, especially since Zyloreans would never betray their own kin.

Yet, amid this chaos, Sarah appeared as a spark of hope. She embodied the potential for humans to grow beyond their destructive instincts. This convinced me even more that I had to warn my people about the lurking darkness within Earth’s population.

Gathering the last of my fading strength, I accessed the communication systems of my craft—an intricate maze of unfamiliar symbols. With determined focus, I worked to translate my message into Zylorean language. My trembling hands navigated the strange controls, desperate to deliver my warning.

After hours of effort, I finally pressed the final sequence. My heart pounded as the transmission began, carrying my voice across space and time. In that moment, the weight of human flaws pressed heavily on me, fueling my plea, especially for Sarah.

“To my fellow Zyloreans, heed my warning! The human race, capable of kindness, harbors a profound darkness. Their endless ambitions drive them to exploit, oppress, and annihilate everything in their path,” I voiced with a trembling voice, filled with sorrow.

“They are consumed by greed for power, possessions, and wealth. They wage wars, ignore the sanctity of life, and fracture their societies—all in pursuit of personal gain. Nothing will stop their relentless drive, and appeals for mercy will fall on deaf ears,” my voice cracked with the weight of my final message.

My thoughts turned to Sarah—an island of hope amidst their treachery. “To Sarah, the one human who revealed to me the true essence of compassion—you are a rare light in this vast darkness. I urge you to persist, to continue striving, and to remind others of the empathy and kindness that still exist within humanity. Nurture that seed of goodness, for the future of your kind depends on individuals like you.”

As my voice faded into the emptiness of space, my energy waned. The burden of my duty, the legacy I carried, fused with my dying breath. I had tried to warn Xyleria—about the dangerous shadows lurking within humanity—a call for caution and vigilance.

And then, I succumbed to my injuries, drifting into eternal silence. My transmission, my last message, floated aimlessly through the cosmos, destined someday to reach my home planet. Perhaps, in time, the Zyloreans would heed my warning and tread carefully when exploring the realm of humans.
