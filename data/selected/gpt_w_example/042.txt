In a realm unseen, beyond the bounds of existence, Death—a supernatural being—drifted through the endless expanse of eternity. His purpose was clear: to bring an end to mortal lives. However, Death was burdened by a profound curse: he could only see one person at a time, and he knew with certainty that he must always take that individual’s life.

Throughout countless ages, Death carried out his timeless duty with unwavering consistency. He did not pass judgment, nor did he show mercy or mercy’s absence. It did not matter whether the person was young or old, virtuous or wicked—their fate was sealed the moment Death’s ethereal gaze fixed upon them.

One day, as Death lingered above a busy cityscape, his attention was caught by a young girl named Isabel. Her eyes held a fragile innocence, a light that beckoned him inexplicably. She was the one he saw—nothing else mattered. From her first breath to her final moment, Death watched her life unfold, witnessing her moments of joy and times of sorrow, as if observing a delicate story he dared not interfere with.

As ages passed, Death became increasingly aware of the heavy burden his curse imposed. He was no longer merely an agent of death; he became a silent witness to the wonder and pain of life. The act of ending existence, once automatic, now weighed heavily on his presence, filling him with a longing to challenge his very nature.

Moved by a newfound compassion, Death made a pivotal decision. He cast aside his divine power to select only one life to take, relinquishing his eternal curse. In so doing, he transformed into a quiet guardian—an unseen guide to souls lost in darkness, helping them find peace in the unknown beyond life.

Unbound by fatality, Death became a being of gentle purpose, whispering softly to those departing from the world, easing their passage. With each journey, he gained a deeper understanding of life's fleeting beauty, forever grateful for the glimpse of humanity his curse had inadvertently granted him.
