My Dearest Lily,

By the time you hold this letter in your hands, I will have departed from this world. I regret to tell you that I have contracted a deadly virus, and despite every effort, there is no cure. The doctors say my time is limited, and soon I will succumb to this merciless illness.

Throughout these last few days, I have fought with all my strength to hold onto life. But as the virus courses through my body, its grip tightens, and I am faced with a painful truth: I must accept my impending death.

My love, you have been my steady anchor, my source of hope and happiness. I thank God every day for bringing you into my life and allowing me to know such profound love. The memories we created will stay with me forever, even as my body weakens with each passing moment.

In these final days, I have found comfort in writing these letters to you. They reflect my thoughts and stand as a testament to the love we shared. I write now, not in despair, but in acceptance.

Please, Lily, do not blame yourself for what is happening. Sometimes, life presents us with challenges we could never anticipate, and this is one of those times. Cherish our moments together and remember that our love was extraordinary, even if it was brief. You have brought warmth and joy into my life, and I will be grateful for that forever.

As I prepare to leave this world, I have reflected on what truly matters in life. It is not the length of our days, but the quality of the moments spent with those we love. I will carry with me forever the memories of our laughter, our adventures, and the love we shared. I hope you will do the same.

Do not let grief overwhelm you, my dear. I want you to continue living with purpose and happiness. Pursue your dreams, seize every opportunity, and love fiercely—as we did. Let my passing remind you that even in darkness, there is still light.

As I say goodbye, know that I am at peace. I have made my peace with the inevitable, and now I can rest. I will watch over you from above, guiding you when the path seems uncertain, standing beside you on your journey.

Remember, my love, that true love outlives even death. Although I am no longer here physically, the love we shared will live on forever.

Thank you for being my everything, Lily. I will love you until my last breath—and beyond.

With all my love,  
Thomas
