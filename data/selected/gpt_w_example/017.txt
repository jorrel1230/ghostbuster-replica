I had always believed in the significance of fate, in the notion that somewhere out there, someone was meant to complete me. Like many others, I bore the last words of my soulmate inscribed on my skin. But when I saw the words that decorated my body, a wave of disbelief washed over me. "I never loved you." 

How could this be true? How could the person who was supposed to bring me joy and fulfillment utter such devastating words? It felt as though cruel destiny had played a harsh trick on me—an unendurable pain that settled deep within my soul. 

Over time, these words became a relentless reminder of my heartbreak. I withdrew into solitude, my spirit shrouded in a haze of sadness. Daily routines felt empty, each moment dipped in bitterness as I grappled with the stark reality etched onto my skin. Yet, through moments of quiet reflection, I realized that those words did not determine my worth. I refused to allow them to diminish my ability to love or be loved. Instead of surrendering to despair, I chose to rise above it.

I started to find comfort in my own company, dedicating myself to my passions and surrounding myself with sincere support from friends and family. I discovered that I held the power to mend my wounded heart—to craft my own story anew. 

Eventually, the pain connected to those words began to fade, replaced by a newfound resilience and strength. Though my soulmate may never return my love, I learned to love myself fiercely, refusing to let the hurt define who I am. 

There is a certain beauty in the scars we carry—testaments to the battles we've endured. Mine, in particular, tell a story of resilience, self-love, and the journey toward discovering happiness within my own heart.
