As the dark shadows lengthened in the narrow alley, a mugger suddenly appeared, wielding a shiny knife. My pulse quickened, yet I remained calm and reached into my pocket to pull out a pack of cards. His eyes flashed with surprise at my unexpected move, confused by my calmness. With steady hands, I started performing remarkable card tricks, mesmerizing him with an array of astonishing illusions. Gradually, his grip on the knife loosened, replaced by a flicker of curiosity. As the cards fluttered and shimmered in my hands, a sense of connection grew between us. He lowered the knife, entranced by the magic unfolding before him, and I sensed an opportunity for a different kind of encounter. That night, the encounter transformed from threat to wonder, brought about by a simple pack of cards.
