After years of silence from outer space, NASA's powerful radio telescope finally caught an extraordinary signal. The message was brief but chilling: "The birds are not what they seem." Anxiety gripped the agency as scientists analyzed the cryptic phrase. Was it a warning? A plea for help? A sense of dread spread across Earth, infecting every mind with suspicion. Over time, the behavior of birds changed dramaticallyâ€”they flocked together in large, unsettling groups, their eyes no longer innocent or gleaming. Their once-melodious songs became strangely menacing, sending ripples of fear through human hearts. The sky turned into a haunting symphony of strange sounds, as humanity slowly realized they might be pawns in an incomprehensible cosmic game.
