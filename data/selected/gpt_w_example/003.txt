In a world where gay marriage became legal worldwide, an unexpected and startling change swept across society. The conservatives, who had long fought against this shift, suddenly found themselves facing their worst fears brought to life. It was as if someone had unleashed an obscure contagion, and people everywhere started openly embracing their same-sex attractions—almost as if a pseudo zombie apocalypse was unfolding. Fear gripped those who could not understand the rapid transformation of their loved ones into individuals seeking love beyond traditional boundaries.

Amidst this chaos, a faint glimmer of hope appeared within a small group of survivors, myself included. We sought safety far from the chaos, in a distant corner of the world. Our goal was twofold: to protect one another from those blinded by love's newfound freedom and to try to understand this strange new reality we faced.

We learned that the real monsters were not those accepting their true selves, but the fear and ignorance that fueled this upheaval. Surviving in this world became more than just enduring— it became an ongoing pursuit of compassion and acceptance. Through hardships, we banded together. Every survivor, no matter their background or orientation, shared stories of struggle—tales of love kept hidden, dreams suppressed, and silent battles fought in secrecy. Freed from the constraints of societal judgment, this diverse group began to value authenticity and understanding.

Together, we forged a new path in a once-dreaded world. Our days started with empathy and open-mindedness. We chose to celebrate love in all its forms and recognized how false the idea of conformity truly was. No longer did we need to hide who we were; authenticity became our strength.

As we worked to rebuild what was lost, we embraced the diversity around us. Prejudice was gradually replaced by acceptance, and the walls of fear crumbled beneath the resilience of human spirit. Our survival proved that love, in its many forms, has the power to overcome even the deepest prejudices.

In this courageous new world, we thrived—not as victims of a destroyed society, but as survivors of an era where love triumphed over the darkest fears and biases.
