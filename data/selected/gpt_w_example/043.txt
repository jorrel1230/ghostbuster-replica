In a world where everyone was given a bracelet that would glow brighter and brighter as they approached the person or thing that would end their life, I had always considered myself fortunate. My bracelet had never lit up since the day I received it, remaining sleek and silver, untouched by the ominous glow that many others experienced. I often disregarded its inactivity, attributing it to a fortunate luck or perhaps an error in the system. While friends and family anxiously monitored their bracelets, I accepted my own immunity from the fear that haunted so many. Life went on, and I figured my moment would come eventually. Until then, I intended to enjoy every worry-free day to the fullest.

One day, while wandering through the busy streets of the city, something drew my attention. Amidst the crowd was a person, seemingly disoriented and lost. Their frantic gestures and desperate glance made my skin crawl. Yet what fascinated me most was the relentless shine emanating from their bracelet—glowing with a brilliance I had never seen before, as if a star had fallen onto their wrist. 

Curiosity took hold of me, overriding my usual apathy, and I found myself approaching this mysterious individual. Their eyes met mine, and in that moment, I sensed an unspoken connection. No words were exchanged, but I knew this encounter would be a turning point in my life. 

"Y-Your bracelet," I stammered, my own voice betraying my surprise. "It’s always glowing?"

The person looked at me with a mix of sorrow and acceptance. "Yes," they replied, their voice heavy with the weight of endless stories left unspoken. "It has never stopped shining since I received it."

A pang of guilt struck me for having complained all these years about my inactive bracelet. Here was someone living under the constant shadow of mortality, their every step haunted by the presence of death. 

As we continued walking through the city, I listened with rapt attention to their accounts of a life spent in perpetual fear. Their bracelet had guided them through countless dangers, bringing them to the verge of death more times than they could count. They spoke of near misses, miraculous escapes, and the relentless anticipation that gripped every moment of their existence.

"Why are you here?" I finally asked, overcome with a mixture of astonishment and sympathy.

A bittersweet laugh escaped them, their eyes flickering like the unending glow of their bracelet. "I believe that even in a world filled with darkness, there is still hope. My purpose is to search for that tiny spark of light that can save us all."

Their words resonated within me, igniting a new flame that had been dormant for too long. In that extraordinary moment, I found the meaning I had been seeking my entire life. I realized that although my bracelet had never lit up, it wasn’t a symbol of luck or invincibility. Rather, it was an opportunity to inspire hope and compassion—an occasion to be a guiding light for those lost in despair.

From that point onward, I joined the person on their journey. Together, we ventured into the darkest corners of the world, shedding light on the forgotten, the hopeless, and the broken. We helped the ill, comforted those in despair, and fought tirelessly for justice.

Although my bracelet had never shone, it had led me to a purpose far greater than mere survival. It brought me to someone whose unwavering light defied the limits of mortality itself. In that shared quest, we found peace and a renewed reason to live—even amidst the ever-present shadow of death.
