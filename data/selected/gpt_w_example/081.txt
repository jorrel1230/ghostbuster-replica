As I realized my new ability to control others, I felt a strange and uneasy weight settle within me. I decided to test my power by choosing a passerby, whose body simply followed my commands. However, then their consciousness spoke to me, its voice gentle yet pleading. What have you done to me? Please, let me go! Overwhelmed by the sincerity of their words, I immediately released them, feeling a swirl of guilt inside. From that moment, I made a promise to myself to use this power carefully, only stepping in when absolutely necessary. Each time, I could hear the person's inner voice—their hopes, fears, and humanity—reminding me of the responsibility I carried. I learned that with great power, there also comes significant empathy and understanding.
