Once upon a time, in a town quite small,  
I found myself cursed with a rhyming spell, after all.  
Every word I spoke, from morning to night,  
Was bound by this curse, quite a peculiar sight.  

I wondered how I should tell those around,  
Without falling deeper into rhyming ground.  
My boss was quite stern, my spouse even more,  
Yet revealing this curse I simply couldn't ignore.  

With nervousness high, I approached my bossâ€™s door,  
Explaining my speech was now a rhyming chore.  
He chuckled and laughed, amused by my plight,  
Then granted me leave for just that night.  

Next came my spouse, with cautious tone,  
Sharing my problem, feeling overthrown.  
At first they were puzzled, then they saw what I mean,  
The curse had become part of this strange routine.  

Finally, I faced my students one day,  
In verses I explained, much to their dismay.  
They found it quite funny, a new kind of class,  
And soon we were rhyming, making a fuss.  

As time went on, I grew to accept my fate,  
Rhyming became my power, my unusual state.  
Though I missed normal speech, I found joy anew,  
In words and in verses, my spirit still grew.  

So if you ever get a strange, rhyming curse,  
Speak softly, be brave, disperse your fears first.  
Embrace your uniqueness, with courage be bold,  
For stories in verse can be wonderfully told.
